# Changelog

## [1.119.0] - 2026-07-24 - a rebuild underneath a scan cannot prove absence (5th refusal rule)

Suite parity with jcodemunch-mcp v1.108.168.

### Fixed

- **Absence evidence could be minted over an index that was being rewritten.**
  v1.117.0 shipped four refusal rules for absence proofs — only `absent` proves
  absence; `low_confidence`/`degraded` do not; a stale index does not; a
  truncated index does not. None covered an index being **rewritten while the
  scan reads it**.

  Index staleness here is `source_dirty`, which reports that the *source* moved.
  It is blind to a reindex that rewrites sections under an unchanged tree, so
  such a scan reported `index: "fresh"`, reached `absent`, and handed back a
  citable `absent:<sha>` ref. That matters more in jdoc than in its siblings:
  sections are scored through a lazy content loader that reads body text from
  disk at scan time, so a rebuild mid-scan can move the very bytes being ranked.

  Zero results plus a detected rewrite now yields `degraded` instead of
  `absent`. Because `degraded` already cannot prove absence, the fifth rule
  falls out of the existing "only `absent` proves absence" check — there is no
  parallel rule to drift. `absence_refusal` names the rebuild rather than the
  generic state.

- **`channels.index` gains `"rebuilding"`**, disclosed on **every** state, not
  only the refused one: a caller reading an `ok` result still deserves to know
  the index moved under it. Only the absence *claim* is withheld — a scan that
  returned sections still returns them.

### Notes

- Detection is a filesystem signal (`DocStore._stamp_load_provenance` stamps the
  monolith path + mtime at both load return points;
  `retrieval.verdict.index_changed_since_load` re-stats it), deliberately **not**
  in-process reindex state, which cannot see a rebuild driven by a separate
  watcher process.
- **Unknown is not changed**: an index with no stamped provenance (a test
  double, a hand-built `DocIndex`) reports unchanged rather than degrading every
  verdict.
- Byte-identical for existing callers when nothing is rebuilding. NO new tool,
  NO tool-count or `INDEX_VERSION` change. New `tests/test_v1_119_0.py` (13).

## [1.118.0] - 2026-07-24 - lexical query no longer lowercased before tokenizing (#91 follow-up)

Reported by @tetiz123 while validating the v1.114.1 CJK tokenizer on a real
111-document / 2,053-section Korean corpus (the fix held: no reindex, and the
lexical channel went from returning nothing to being their best ranker). While
measuring, they found a second, unrelated defect with a one-line cause.

`DocIndex._lexical_search` computed `query.lower()` and handed that to the
scorer. But `bm25.tokenize` inserts CamelCase boundaries BEFORE it lowercases,
so the two sides of the match disagreed for any identifier that carries case:

    document side  tokenize("OvertimeService")  -> ['overtime', 'service']
    query side     tokenize("overtimeservice")  -> ['overtimeservice']

Every code-identifier query — the one thing a keyword ranker should be
unbeatable at — scored 0.0 and returned a silent empty list. It is silent
rather than an error because the Stage-A posting prune tokenizes the ORIGINAL
query, so candidates survive the prune and then each one scores 0. CamelCase
(`OvertimeService`) and acronym-plus-suffix (`HCA060T`) identifiers were hit;
underscore-separated names (`SPM_NOTIFICATION`) were not, because the delimiter
is case-independent.

Fix: pass the raw query to the scorer. `tokenize` lowercases internally after
the de-camel step, so feeding it the original text is both correct and
redundant-work-free. `_score_section`'s first argument is renamed accordingly;
`query_words` (the tag kicker) still uses the lowercased set, since tags are
matched case-folded. Consumer-layer only, no reindex: `tokenize` runs over
stored content at scoring time.

New `tests/test_v1_118_0.py` (7): the tokenizer asymmetry at the root, plus
end-to-end lexical retrieval for CamelCase / acronym / repository-suffix
identifiers, an underscore control, and a lowercase-prose control that must not
regress. Additive/1.x, no INDEX_VERSION or tool-count change; suite 1831.

Shipped from MASTER as a patch (like 1.114.1 / 1.114.2 / 1.116.0 / 1.117.0)
while `coordinated-retirement` (1.115.0) stays HELD for rknighton's
re-verification; on merge, resolve version conflicts to the higher number and
keep all CHANGELOG entries.

## [1.117.0] - 2026-07-24 - absence evidence (handoff/v2 phase 3, suite parity)

Suite parity with jcodemunch-mcp v1.108.166 (jcodemunch-mcp#377 phase 3, design
by @mightydanp). A zero-result section search can now be cited as evidence in a
handoff. Under v1/v2 it could not: nothing was served, so there was no id to
reference. But "we searched the complete, fresh, non-truncated index and it is
not there" is exactly the claim an audit most needs attested.

`retrieval/verdict.build_verdict` already reports state (`ok` / `low_confidence`
/ `absent` / `degraded`), scan counts, per-channel status, coverage, and a
scorer pin. A search whose verdict is `absent` now surfaces a citable ref;
passing it to `finalize_handoff` attests the absence. Because jdoc's default
`meta_fields` strips `_meta` entirely (the v1.104.0 lesson), the ref rides in
`_meta.absence_evidence`, re-attached AFTER filtering so the token-efficient
default cannot delete a token the agent needs to cite.

The refusal rules are the feature, adopted as proposed: only `absent` proves
absence; `low_confidence` and `degraded` do not; a stale index does not; a
truncated index does not. A refused scan is still recorded, so citing one
returns the reason (`refused_absence`, or `refused_absence_claims` naming the
claim) rather than a bare unknown-ref error. The rendered proof carries the
tool and query, the scope it was not found in, sections and documents scanned,
channel status, coverage with exclusion counts, and the scorer. Unknown
coverage is disclosed as unknown, never rendered as a complete scope.

Refs are content-addressed over `(tool, repo, query, scope)`. Session-scoped,
in-memory, capped, never on disk. Receipt gains `absence_attested` when cited.
Additive/1.x, no INDEX_VERSION or tool-count change. Tests
`tests/test_v1_117_0.py` (23, one per refusal rule); suite 1824.

## [1.116.0] - 2026-07-23 - claim-scoped evidence (handoff/v2 phase 1, suite parity)

Claim-scoped evidence, suite parity with jcodemunch-mcp v1.108.165
(jcodemunch-mcp#377 phase 1, design by @mightydanp). A handoff section may now
carry caller-authored `claims`, each with its own `evidence_refs`. v1 proved a
cited ref was retrieved this session but never bound it to a sentence: refs
landed in one global block at the end of the body.

New `_validate_claims` takes `{id, statement, evidence_refs, classification?}`.
Ids are unique across the WHOLE handoff, not per section, since the id is the
citation anchor and two sections owning one id would make a citation ambiguous.
Statements and classifications are preserved verbatim; the server never
rewrites one. Each claim's refs are attested separately through the unchanged
`_validate_evidence`, so an unknown ref returns `invalid_claims:
[{claim_id, unknown_refs}]` and names the claim that cited it instead of
vanishing into one global failure list. `render_handoff` prints the claim as a
`###` heading with its evidence indented beneath.

Three decisions carried from the jcm implementation:

- The input picks the contract. No claims anywhere means the schema string
  stays `jdocmunch.handoff/v1` and the body is byte-identical to what v1 rendered;
  `claims_attested` is omitted from the receipt rather than reported as `0`.
  Any claim promotes the handoff to `jdocmunch.handoff/v2`.
- Claims can satisfy `evidence_refs`: the top-level list may be empty when
  claims carry refs, so a caller who scoped everything to claims need not
  restate it. Strictly more permissive; no existing call changes.
- Claim refs join the canonical evidence index, caller order first, so a v1
  consumer reading a v2 handoff still sees every reference where it expects.

Section `content` becomes optional only for a section carrying claims.
Additive/1.x, no INDEX_VERSION or tool-count change.

Known limit, disclosed on the tracking issue before anyone builds against it:
phase 1 does not narrow what counts as a match. Attestation still accepts a
broader reference than the claim, so citing a whole document attests
even when only one unrelated member of it was served. Narrowing that is phase
2 (evidence receipts), which is deferred.

Tests `tests/test_v1_116_0.py` (18, incl. the byte-identical v1 guard); suite 1801.
**Shipped from MASTER as a patch (like 1.114.1 / 1.114.2) while
`coordinated-retirement` (1.115.0) stays HELD for rknighton's re-verification.
Version 1.115.0 is deliberately skipped here so the held branch keeps it; on
merge, resolve version conflicts to the higher number and keep all CHANGELOG
entries.**

## [1.115.0] - 2026-07-22 - QA-01/QA-03: coordinated & recoverable retirement, truly read-only report (#88)

The remaining two findings from @rknighton's #88 adversarial QA.

**QA-01 (High):** every retirement path proved the relationship, rechecked it,
then deleted — and an index that changed between the recheck and the physical
removal was still removed under the stale decision. `DocStore.delete_index`
now accepts proof-time `expected_fingerprints` (sha256 of each handle's
monolith, retiring AND retained) and re-verifies them inside the deletion
boundary, before any removal. A mismatch raises `RetirementConflict` with
nothing touched; the three retirement sites (legacy apply, supersession,
exact-dedup graduation) report it as `legacy_reconcile_conflict`,
`supersession_conflict`, and the new `graduation_conflict`, each with a
`changed_handles` list and both indexes kept.

**Recoverability (QA-01/QA-02):** a durable retiring record
(`<owner>/.retirements/<name>.json` — retiring + retained handles,
fingerprints, family, start time) is written before the destructive step.
Removed on success and on conflict; kept when cleanup fails, so pending work
survives a crash as a discoverable fact (`pending_retirement: true` in
cleanup-incomplete responses). A refresh of a retiring handle cancels the
pending retirement rather than racing it, and `delete_index` clears the
record once the primary record is gone.

**QA-03 (Medium):** `legacy_reconcile="report"` is documented as proof-only
but ran the full refresh first, rewriting the legacy index whenever source
files changed. Report now diverts before the refresh and proves from stored
snapshots plus live Git evidence: both indexes certified clean at one SHA and
the live checkout clean at that same SHA — three clean legs at one commit
mean the stored snapshots describe the live tree, no refresh needed. Zero
writes on every outcome; responses carry `_meta.read_only: true`. A genuinely
uncertified legacy index reports `legacy_reconcile_uncertified` honestly
(apply, which refreshes under C.2 intent, remains the certify-and-retire
path).

**Pre-production corrections (#89, @rknighton):** the branch QA pass found
the coordination above still left a proof-to-capture gap and an
unverified recovery record; both fixed before this release shipped.

- **QA-06 (High):** the three retirement paths now run one coordinated
  destructive step — fingerprints captured FIRST, decisive proof re-run on a
  reload the token covers, then the guarded delete verifies the fingerprints
  at entry AND immediately before the primary record is removed (a concurrent
  save or direct delete of the retained peer mid-cleanup now conflicts with
  every index still loadable). A missing/unreadable fingerprint fails closed
  (`None` never authorizes), and `delete_index` holds the same cross-process
  write lock as the save paths — every writer and direct delete of a handle
  joins one lifecycle coordinator. Only the target handle is ever locked, so
  cross-handle lock ordering (and its deadlock surface) never arises.
- **QA-07 (Medium):** `begin_retirement` returns a durable publication
  receipt (fsync'd record, per-publication-unique temp name — two
  same-process publishers can no longer collide on one PID-based temp path)
  and cleanup never starts without it; a failed publication reports
  cleanup-incomplete with nothing removed. `pending_retirement: true` is
  claimed only when the record actually exists, and the save paths cancel a
  pending record only AFTER their atomic replace lands (a failed save
  preserves the record).
- **QA-08:** a record whose retiring index no longer exists is a completed
  retirement — self-healed, never reported pending. **QA-09/QA-10** (policy):
  a rewrite or direct delete of the RETAINED handle voids any record naming
  it as retained (fail-visible; the next reconcile re-proves). **QA-11**
  (contract): record publication is fsync'd, so the receipt survives sudden
  power loss. **QA-15:** the POSIX write lock re-verifies its inode after
  acquisition, so lockfile deletion can't split coordination across two
  inodes.

**Completion QA (#90, @rknighton):**

- **QA-17 (High):** pair coordination previously ended at the final
  fingerprint check — a retained-peer delete landing between that check and
  the primary unlink could still leave both indexes absent. The retirement
  record is now the PAIR coordination point: the guarded delete executes its
  final gate (fingerprint re-verify, record-existence check, primary unlink,
  record removal) under a lock on its own retirement record, and any delete
  first voids the records naming its target as retained THROUGH that same
  lock (bounded wait) before touching anything. Void lands before the gate →
  the gate finds the record gone and conflicts, keeping the retiring handle.
  Gate already closed → the retained-peer delete is refused (returns False;
  a retry succeeds as soon as the gate opens, normally milliseconds). No
  interleaving finishes with both participating indexes absent, and no
  caller ever blocks on two locks — the single-handle lock design (and its
  absent deadlock surface) is preserved.
- **QA-18:** corrected below — the #89 harness claim now states the exact
  results instead of "pass in full."

**Issue #95 merge-closure candidate:** retirement publication is now
commit-scoped: record creation, replacement, and removal are coordinated, final
authorization requires the exact current publication, and fingerprints are
re-proved after retained-handle coordination. Public `delete_index` makes one
nonblocking lifecycle-coordination attempt while internal retirement keeps its
bounded wait; successful deletion preserves the stable per-index lockfile.
The public deleted, missing, and lifecycle-busy results have one authoritative
runtime vocabulary, with a `SPEC.md` table and drift guard. QA-25's explicit
caller wait policy and nonblocking default were preserved and independently
verified, not redesigned.

Current candidate evidence is limited to focused local Windows validation and
the unchanged frozen lifecycle harness. No Linux or submission-readiness claim
is made here.

Additive and 1.x-compatible: new defaulted kwarg, new exception only raised
when that kwarg is passed, new response keys, no INDEX_VERSION bump. Tests:
`tests/test_v1_115_0.py` (10) + `tests/test_v1_115_0_qa89.py` (10) +
`tests/test_v1_115_0_qa90.py` (4); @rknighton's `qa_adversarial_test.py`
passes 8/8 verbatim. His #89 `qa_blockers.py` passes 9/9; `qa_process.py`
passes 5/6 — the one flip is `test_observation_direct_retained_delete`, his
explicitly-labeled current-behavior observation, which now asserts pre-#89
behavior by design (the QA-10 policy voids the record on a retained-handle
direct delete). His #90 `qa_atomic_gap.py` both-indexes-absent state is
unreachable: the mid-gate retained delete is refused, so the harness stops
at its delete-returns-True assert while the invariant it protects holds.
## [1.114.2] - 2026-07-23 - canonical handoff contract: finalize_handoff + munch://handoff/<id> (suite parity, jcodemunch-mcp #374)

New tool `finalize_handoff` (`jdocmunch.handoff/v1`) + resource
`munch://handoff/<id>` — suite parity with jcodemunch-mcp v1.108.162. A
multi-step documentation audit ends with one authoritative, server-owned
Markdown handoff: the assistant authors the analysis; the server
deterministically assembles the caller's sections plus optional named
appendices (each exactly once, duplicates rejected), validates every
`evidence_refs` entry against the session's actual retrieval record
(section ids and doc paths served by `search_sections` / `search_titles` /
`get_section` / `get_sections`, recorded at the response chokepoint; unknown
refs fail closed with an `unknown_refs` list), persists session-scoped in
memory, and returns a compact receipt `{handoff_id, resource_uri, sha256,
length, canonical: true}`. The resource serves the immutable body with
byte-identical repeated reads; `canonical: true` is advisory metadata only.
No character limit; never writes to the documentation corpus; standard tier;
`readOnlyHint: false`. Tool count 63 → 64. Additive/1.x, no INDEX_VERSION
bump. Tests `tests/test_v1_114_2.py` (15).

## [1.114.1] - 2026-07-23 - BM25 tokenizer: Unicode word splitting + CJK character bigrams (#91)

Reported by @tetiz123. The BM25 split regex was `[^a-z0-9]+`, so every
non-ASCII character acted as a separator: Korean/Japanese/Chinese content
produced zero tokens (the lexical channel contributed nothing, and installs
without an embedding provider had no working search at all for those corpora),
and accented Latin was mangled (`café` → `caf`). The module docstring claimed
Unicode word boundaries; the implementation now actually delivers them.

The tokenizer splits on Unicode word boundaries (`[\W_]+`), keeps accented
Latin intact, and expands CJK runs (Hangul, Hiragana/Katakana, Han) into
overlapping character bigrams — CJK has no whitespace word boundaries, and
since index time and query time share the same expansion, bigram overlap is
the match signal. Mixed-script tokens (`초과근무OvertimeService`) split
cleanly; CamelCase/snake_case handling, URL expansion, frontmatter/fence
scrubbing, and English stop-words are unchanged, and pure-ASCII corpora
tokenize exactly as before. `search_titles`'s private ASCII-only tokenizer
gets the same treatment via a new shared `word_tokens` helper.

No reindex needed: BM25 tokenizes stored section content at scoring time, so
existing indexes pick up CJK-capable lexical scoring immediately.

## [1.114.0] - 2026-07-22 - QA-04/QA-05: disclose failed Git verification, complete the result-code contract (#88)

@rknighton's follow-up QA on #88.

**QA-04 (Medium):** `doc_resolve_repo` returned the same ordinary not-found
response whether Git confirmed a path as non-Git or Git verification failed
outright (missing binary, timeout, permissions). A failed verification now adds
a structured `git_verification` block (`verified: false`, reason code
`git_verification_unavailable`) and a hint explaining that worktree-based
canonical-index discovery was skipped. The provisional-creation path is
unchanged: `index_local` still works in this state and quarantines the new
index as provisional.

**QA-05 (Low):** SPEC.md claimed a complete, drift-guarded result vocabulary,
but the read-time resolver emitted reason codes written as inline string
literals (e.g. `unique_location_candidate`) that bypassed the guard's
STATUS_*/REASON_* attribute scan. All twelve resolver codes are now module
constants, documented in a new `worktree_resolution.reason_code` table, and a
new AST guard rejects any future inline `reason_code` literal in src.
Related corrections in the same pass:

- `provisional_cap_exceeded` and `legacy_reconcile_not_applicable` are
  documented as top-level `error` codes — the field where they are actually
  returned — instead of reason-code table rows.
- USER_GUIDE.md documents the `legacy_reconcile="report"|"apply"` workflow.
- The v1.108.0 changelog date is corrected (2026-07-28 → 2026-07-20).

Additive and 1.x-compatible: one new response block on an existing error path,
no tool or schema change, no INDEX_VERSION bump. Tests:
`tests/test_v1_114_0.py` (7); the attached `test_remaining_qa_findings.py`
harness passes 3/3 without weakened assertions.

## [1.113.0] - 2026-07-22 - QA-02 contained fixes: retirement delete result is authoritative (#88)

@rknighton's adversarial QA on the reconciliation lifecycle (#88) found three
reproducible gaps. This release ships the two contained QA-02 fixes; the
QA-01 refresh/retirement coordination and QA-03 read-only report follow in a
dedicated coordinated-retirement release.

- **Exact-duplicate graduation honors the delete result.** The
  identity-plus-hash-proven duplicate path in `_resolve_graduation`
  (`tools/index_local.py`) called `store.delete_index(...)` and ignored the
  return, reporting `reconciled` + `removed_handle` even when removal returned
  `False`. It now checks the result: on a failed removal it reports the new
  recoverable `graduation_cleanup_incomplete` reason code, keeps both indexes
  discoverable, and never emits a `removed_handle` for a loser that still
  exists. The happy path is unchanged.
- **Partial cleanup stays discoverable and retryable.** `DocStore.delete_index`
  (`storage/doc_store.py`) unlinked the primary `<name>.json` record FIRST,
  then removed the content cache and sidecars. If a later removal raised, the
  index was already un-loadable, so the documented retry could not find the
  handle. The primary record is now removed LAST — content cache, summary, and
  sidecars go first — so any mid-cleanup failure leaves the index fully
  loadable and the retry succeeds.

New `REASON_GRADUATION_CLEANUP_INCOMPLETE` in `_worktree_corpus.py`, added to
the B4 vocabulary drift-guard (`test_v1_106_0.py`) and the published
`SPEC.md` status/reason_code table. Additive/1.x — no tool add/rename, no wire
break (the failed-delete case previously mis-reported success), no
`INDEX_VERSION` bump. Tests: `tests/test_v1_113_0.py` (4). QA-01/QA-03 remain
open on the #88 tracker for the coordinated-retirement build.

## [1.112.0] - 2026-07-21 - tool-surface schema receipt in session stats (suite parity, jcodemunch-mcp v1.108.153)

`get_session_stats` now carries an advisory `tool_surface` block: visible vs
catalog tool counts (after `JDOCMUNCH_TOOL_PROFILE` + `JDOCMUNCH_DISABLED_TOOLS`
filtering), estimated schema tokens for each, `schema_tokens_avoided` by the
active profile, and the top-15 heaviest tool schemas. Estimated at the meter's
bytes/4 scale over the `{name, description, inputSchema}` serialization. jDoc
has no Counter surface, so the block carries `profile` but no `surface` key.
Read-only, computed inline on the stats call only, nothing persisted; a probe
failure omits the block rather than failing the call. Additive/1.x — no new
tool, no schema change, no INDEX_VERSION bump. Tests: `tests/test_v1_112_0.py`
(6).

## [1.111.0] - 2026-07-21 - runtime identity resource (suite parity, jcodemunch-mcp#371)

New MCP resource `munch://runtime/identity` — a read-only
`munch.runtime.identity/v1` JSON document giving multi-agent harnesses process
provenance for this server instance: `schema`, `product`, `version`,
`transport`, `pid`, `process_start {value, source}`, `instance_id`, and an
optional `launch_id` echo. `process_start` is OS-derived when obtainable
(Windows `GetProcessTimes`; Linux `/proc/self/stat` starttime + btime) with
`source: "os"`; when the OS probe is unavailable the value is the module's own
first-read clock, disclosed as `source: "self_recorded"` — never presented as
OS evidence. `instance_id` is a uuid4 minted once per process lifetime, so a
restart (even with a reused PID) yields a new identity. `launch_id` echoes
`JDOCMUNCH_LAUNCH_ID` (fallback `MUNCH_LAUNCH_ID`) and is omitted when unset.
Deliberately excluded: command lines, env, cwd, hostnames, corpus paths, task
data. Delivered as a resource, not a tool — no tool-count or schema change and
zero cost when unused; on-demand read only, no background or network behavior.
Additive/1.x. New module `runtime_identity.py`; tests `tests/test_v1_111_0.py`
(11). Same contract ships in jcodemunch-mcp v1.108.152 and jdatamunch-mcp
v1.22.0.

## [1.110.0] - 2026-07-21 - Part C.2: explicit-intent legacy reconciliation (#87)

The final build of the #80 identity arc: proving a genuine pre-1.102
fieldless legacy index redundant against its modern peer, and retiring it —
only ever under explicit caller intent, behind the same hard Git proof gates
as the modern supersession path.

- New `index_local(legacy_reconcile="report"|"apply")`. `report` proves
  readiness without changing anything; `apply` repeats the proof immediately
  before the only destructive step. Omitted (the default), an ordinary
  refresh stays exactly what it was: backfill-only, never retires.
- The explicitly selected legacy handle is the only possible loser. The
  operation requires an explicit `name=`, a handle that is fieldless at call
  start, a full refresh, default `worktree_mode`, and confirmed Git lineage;
  any miss refuses fail-closed (`legacy_reconcile_not_applicable`) with no
  write.
- Retirement proof: exactly one non-provisional modern peer matching the
  verified corpus identity (lineage + relative root + durable selection),
  both indexes clean and certified at the same commit, and every
  selected-handle path present in the peer with the same stored hash — a
  missing hash is unproven, never assumed. Zero peers reports
  `legacy_reconcile_no_modern_peer`; several report
  `legacy_reconcile_ambiguous`; nothing is ever removed on a failed proof.
- Basename disclosure (`legacy_index_present`) never enters the proof set
  (LC2-02): identity is matched on verified lineage evidence only.
- `apply` reuses the #86 retirement primitive: final recheck immediately
  before deletion (`legacy_reconcile_conflict` on drift, nothing removed),
  loud + idempotent cleanup failure (`legacy_reconcile_cleanup_incomplete`),
  leftover sidecars disclosed. The peer is never touched; the success
  response returns its handle with `removed_handle`/`removed_file_count`.
- Under C.2 intent the selected handle deliberately stays fieldless (no
  identity backfill), so a retry after any mid-flight failure still passes
  the fieldless-at-call-start gate. Backfill remains the ordinary refresh's
  job.
- Nine new reason codes, all additive, in the B4 drift guard and the
  published SPEC.md vocabulary table (the #84 contract).
- Tests: `tests/test_v1_110_0.py` (12; real Git repos + linked worktrees,
  peer verified byte-for-byte across apply, drift + cleanup-failure rows).

Additive/1.x: new optional kwarg + new response keys only; calls without
`legacy_reconcile` are byte-identical. No INDEX_VERSION bump.

## [1.109.0] - 2026-07-21 - modern verified-snapshot supersession (#86)

The dedicated modern-snapshot follow-up to the #80 identity arc. When a
provisional and an established index represent the same verified corpus at
different certified commits, Git ancestry now resolves them — behind proof
gates that keep every other pair untouched.

- **MS-02 — strict-ancestor provisional retires.** When the provisional's
  snapshot is certified clean at a valid commit, still current in its
  checkout, and Git proves it a strict ancestor of the established index's
  certified snapshot, the older provisional is retired (loser only; the
  established index is byte-for-byte unchanged) and the established handle
  returned. Reason code `superseded_by_established` carries both SHAs, the
  relationship, and `removed_handle`/`removed_file_count`. A final
  identity/candidate/generation recheck runs immediately before the one
  destructive step; any drift returns `supersession_conflict` with nothing
  removed.
- **MS-01 — descendant provisional never supersedes.** The established index
  is never replaced, retargeted, or aliased automatically. Reason code
  `provisional_newer_than_established` reports both SHAs and the explicit
  completion path: refresh the established handle from this checkout, then
  re-run — exact deduplication (v1.108.0) finishes the job (MS-03).
- **MS-04 — every negative boundary preserved.** Equal hashes still use exact
  dedup; diverged, unordered (`ancestry` reported), unproven, dirty,
  uncertified, stale-snapshot, provisional-peer, and multiple-peer pairs keep
  both indexes. A cleanup failure is visible
  (`supersession_cleanup_incomplete`, or `cleanup_incomplete` +
  `leftover_files` on the success disclosure) and retries idempotently.
- **New `commit_ancestry` helper** (`tools/_git.py`): fail-closed, bounded
  git probes; any non-determination is `unproven`, never an ordering.
- **Published vocabulary table.** SPEC.md now carries the complete
  runtime-matched status/reason-code table (the #84 item-4 contract), with a
  test that fails if the runtime can emit an undocumented value.

Additive/1.x: four new reason codes (drift-guarded + published), new response
keys, no tool/schema change, no INDEX_VERSION bump. Tests:
`tests/test_v1_109_0.py` (11, real Git repos + linked worktrees). Full suite
1716 passed.

## [1.108.0] - 2026-07-20 - C.1 hardening: hash-proven duplicates, complete cleanup, honest listings (#85)

rknighton's focused QA pass on the 1.107.0 graduation work reproduced four
gaps; all closed, his harness passing 4/4.

- **C1-01/C1-02 — exact-duplicate cleanup now requires content proof.** The
  reconcile auto-cleanup gated only on Git-verified identity plus path
  coverage, so a provisional index holding DIFFERENT content for the same
  paths could be removed as though it were a duplicate. A second destructive-
  safety gate now requires every retired file to exist in the surviving index
  with the same stored hash; a mismatch (or an unprovable hash) keeps both
  indexes and reports the new additive reason code
  `graduation_content_differs` with the differing files (capped at 20),
  the established handle, and a suggested next action. A successful
  reconcile response now also confirms what was removed (`removed_handle`,
  `removed_file_count`).
- **C1-05 — dirty state.** Exact path/hash equality still proves duplication
  regardless of Git cleanliness; differing dirty content is never removed
  (Git ancestry cannot order uncommitted snapshots).
- **C1-06 — hashes never replace the identity gate.** Hash equality without
  verified lineage never reconciles (explicit negative test).
- **C1-03 — controlled supersession: decided and deferred.** Supersession
  between fully certified, ancestry-ordered modern snapshots is accepted in
  principle but is NOT in this hardening pass; until it ships as its own
  focused build with atomic-failure coverage, different-content pairs remain
  separate and visible.
- **C1-07/C1-08 — complete cleanup of a retired index.** `delete_index` (and
  therefore reconcile auto-cleanup) now removes every index-owned auxiliary
  sidecar: `.embeddings.jsonl`, `.terms.json`, `.related.json`,
  `.boilerplate.json`, `.duplicates.json`.
- **C1-09 — identity version survives listings.** The summary sidecar and
  `list_repos` rows now carry `corpus_identity_version`, so a modern index is
  never presented as pre-1.102 legacy. A summary written before the key
  existed falls back to the monolith and self-heals on the next save.

Additive/1.x: one new reason code (covered by the vocabulary drift guard),
new response keys, no tool/schema change, no INDEX_VERSION bump. Tests:
`tests/test_v1_108_0.py` (7, adapted from the attached harness plus the
C1-05/C1-06 decided cases). Full suite 1705 passed.

## [1.107.0] - 2026-07-20 - provisional-index graduation (#80 Part C)

Part C of the local-index reconciliation arc: a provisional index (created
under failed Git verification in Part B) can now graduate when the proof
arrives, behind six security invariants so promotion can never be manufactured.

When a provisional index is FULLY refreshed (`index_local`, no `paths` subset)
and Git lineage is now CONFIRMED, one of:

- **Graduate in place.** No established index shares the identity, so the
  provisional is promoted: identity fields written, provisional flag cleared,
  it becomes a normal established index.
- **Reconcile (auto-cleanup).** An established index already holds this
  identity, so the provisional is the loser: it is removed and the established
  handle is returned, but ONLY after confirming the provisional's documents are
  a subset of the established index (no document loss). The established index is
  never modified.
- **Fail closed and stay provisional** when it would not be safe: more than one
  established index matches the identity (ambiguous), or the provisional holds
  documents the established index lacks (diverged, so it is never deleted).

The gate is the same positive proof #83 requires (confirmed lineage), never
weaker and never an accumulation of grey-area signals; provisional indexes are
excluded from the candidate set, so they never vouch for each other; promotion
is event-driven (a verifying refresh), never time-driven; and conflicts never
touch the established index. A subset refresh, a still-unverifiable refresh, and
any volume of provisional accretion never produce a graduation.

New pure `classify_graduation` helper plus graduation outcome vocabulary
(`graduated_verified`, `reconciled_to_established`, `graduation_ambiguous`,
`graduation_content_diverged`), all covered by the drift-guard. Tests:
`tests/test_v1_107_0.py` (13, including the adversarial invariant gate).
Additive / 1.x, no INDEX_VERSION bump. Deferred to a follow-on: pre-1.102
legacy physical-index merge (§4.3); Part B already discloses that case
(`legacy_index_present`).

## [1.106.0] - 2026-07-20 - reconciliation quarantine, quarantine-only (#80 Part B)

Part B of the local-index reconciliation arc (#80), the safe foundation the
Part C reconciler is built on. **Quarantine only, with no graduation path** —
a quarantined index stays quarantined until Part C.

- **Provisional stamp on failed Git verification.** When both git
  common-directory probes are *unavailable* (timeout, missing binary, or OS
  error — not a clean not-a-repository answer), `index_local` still creates the
  index (availability over a transient git failure) but stamps it
  `reconciliation_state = "provisional"` and discloses a structured
  `reconciliation` block on the response. A new `_git_probe` classifies the
  failure so a genuine non-Git corpus (git ran and said no) stays normal while
  only an unanswerable probe quarantines. New additive `DocIndex.reconciliation_state`
  (omit-when-empty; carried through save / incremental / summary sidecar /
  list_repos row; no INDEX_VERSION bump).
- **Authority-free while provisional.** A provisional index is excluded from
  worktree reuse candidates, so it can never become an `established_handle` or
  suppress creation of the real corpus. It carries no lineage key and never
  graduates in Part B — a refresh preserves the provisional state (no silent
  promotion via reindex).
- **Per-source_root provisional cap.** Creation beyond a small per-root ceiling
  fails closed with `provisional_cap_exceeded` rather than letting many
  marginal provisional indexes accrue silently.
- **`legacy_index_present` disclosure.** When a fresh index is created and an
  older (pre-1.102, identity-fieldless) index for a plausibly equivalent corpus
  exists, the response flags it so the duplicate is not silent and the caller
  can reindex the older corpus into the lineage system.
- **Vocabulary drift-guard.** A test asserts every Part B status / reason_code
  the runtime can emit is documented, keeping the public vocabulary honest
  until Part C publishes the complete runtime-matched table.

Graduation and reconciliation (promoting a provisional index to established,
merging pre-1.102 duplicates) are **Part C**, gated behind a single hard proof
gate — a genuine git-verified identity match, never an accumulation of
grey-area signals. Tests: `tests/test_v1_106_0.py` (10). Additive / 1.x.

## [1.105.1] - 2026-07-20 - consistent candidate-list bound on doc_resolve_repo (#84)

QA follow-up (@rknighton) on the 1.102.0 worktree-reuse work. On the
`doc_resolve_repo` not-found worktree path, the nested
`worktree_resolution.candidates` list correctly capped at five records with
`total_candidates` reporting the true count, but the top-level
`canonical_candidates` list returned every record found. Both public lists now
share the same five-record bound; the full number found stays reported via
`worktree_resolution.total_candidates`. One-line assembly fix in
`tools/resolve_repo.py` (reusing the shared `MAX_CANDIDATES` constant); the
resolver and every other response field are unchanged. Boundary regression
coverage added at exactly five and six records, plus the eight-record
reproduction and zero/one sanity cases (`tests/test_v1_105_1.py`, 5).
Additive/1.x; no INDEX_VERSION bump. Items 2 through 4 of the report are
policy decisions parked for the Part C reconciliation phase.

## [1.105.0] - 2026-07-19 - office document ingestion (.pdf/.docx/.pptx/.epub)

New optional extra: `pip install jdocmunch-mcp[office]` teaches local
indexing (`index_local` / `index-file` / the `watch` daemon) to ingest
PDF, Word, PowerPoint, and EPUB documents. Files are converted to
Markdown on-machine at read time via Microsoft's MIT-licensed markitdown
(local converters only — the cloud converters it offers are never
enabled, so no network request originates from conversion), then
sectioned, searched, and health-checked like any other doc. Converted
output is cached under the storage root (`.office_cache/`, keyed by
file-content hash + converter version) so refreshes never re-convert
unchanged documents; discovery applies a 25MB office-specific size cap
(binary sources run large while their extracted Markdown stays small).
Without the extra, office files are skipped at discovery with a distinct
coverage-report reason (`office_extra_not_installed`); `index-file`
returns a clean install hint. Live-source freshness reproduces the
conversion leg (cache hit for unchanged files) and falls back to the
stored mirror when conversion is unavailable. Deliberate boundaries:
tabular formats (`.csv`/`.xlsx`) stay with jdatamunch-mcp, and the
GitHub remote leg does not fetch office files — local-only. Additive/
1.x: base install is byte-identical, no INDEX_VERSION bump (office docs
enter an index on the next refresh like any newly-discovered file).
Tests: `tests/test_v1_105_0.py` (10).

## [1.104.0] - 2026-07-19 - advisory session token budget

Suite parity with jcodemunch-mcp v1.108.146. Set
`JDOCMUNCH_SESSION_TOKEN_BUDGET` to an advisory ceiling over response
tokens served (the context this server injects into the agent, counted at
the response chokepoint with the same bytes/4 estimate the savings meter
uses). Once the session crosses 80% of the limit, every response carries
`_meta.budget = {limit, spent, state}` (`approaching` at >=80%, `over` at
>=100%) — attached AFTER meta_fields filtering, so the warning survives
the token-efficient default that strips `_meta` (an advisory the default
config silently deletes would be no advisory at all). `get_session_stats`
gains `session_response_tokens` and, when configured, the `budget` block
in all three states. Never blocks, throttles, or truncates — awareness
only; hard caps belong to the gateway layer. Unset/`0` disables and the
wire is byte-identical. Additive/1.x; inline compute, no new background
or network behavior, no INDEX_VERSION bump. Tests:
`tests/test_v1_104_0.py` (9).

## [1.103.0] - 2026-07-19 - coverage contract on absence claims

Prompted by community feedback on the retrieval-verdict article: an
`absent` verdict backed only by scan counts lies by omission when files
were excluded at index time. A doc index now remembers what its discovery
walk left out, and an absence claim discloses it.

Index time: every full discovery walk of `index_local` (no explicit
`paths`) persists a coverage block on the index (`DocIndex.coverage`):
walk kind, files indexed, per-reason skip counts tallied at the existing
discovery skip sites (unsupported extension, oversize, gitignored, skip
patterns, secret files, symlink and traversal guards, stat/read errors),
the count of files that parsed to zero sections, and a UTC timestamp.
Incremental and subset (`paths`) saves carry the block forward unchanged;
the next full re-walk overwrites it (self-heals). No index-format version
bump: the field follows the established omit-when-empty convention, and
legacy indexes load with an empty block.

Query time: `search_sections` and `find_endpoint` attach a `coverage`
block to `absent`/`degraded` verdicts only, via the new
`index_coverage_meta` helper: generation metadata (`indexed_at`,
`index_version`, `git_head` first 12 when tracked), `files_indexed`,
`excluded` per-reason counts, and `no_sections_files`. When the index
predates the contract the block is omitted entirely; empty coverage means
unknown, never fabricated. `ok`/`low_confidence` verdicts stay lean.
`build_verdict` also gains a `scorer` integer version pin (starts at 1)
so a stated confidence ties to the scorer that produced it.

Suite parity with jCodeMunch v1.108.145; clean-room jDoc shape (sections,
not symbols). Additive, 1.x-compatible: new persisted field, new response
keys on negative verdicts only. Tests: `tests/test_v1_103_0.py` (9).

## [1.102.0] - 2026-07-18 - reuse an established corpus index across linked Git worktrees (#83)

Item B of the #80 identity meta-issue, PRD by @rknighton. The same
documentation corpus checked out in two linked Git worktrees used to
produce two duplicate physical indexes and a not-found resolution from the
second worktree. One side-effect-free resolver, shared by both public
tools, now translates identity across worktrees: logical identity =
linked-worktree lineage (Git common directory, never inferred from remote
URL, commit, folder name, or content) + repository-relative corpus
location + the Item A durable selection. doc_resolve_repo additively
returns established handles as bounded canonical_candidates with a
worktree_resolution evidence object, read-only, with selection reported
unavailable. index_local reuses a proven-fresh equivalent (same certified
revision, no relevant uncommitted docs) by returning the established
handle with no write; stale, dirty, ambiguous, legacy-unresolved, or
evidence-incomplete outcomes return bounded decisions with no write; new
worktree_mode="branch_local" intentionally creates an exact-path index.
Cross-worktree creation races contend on one lineage-keyed claim with an
under-claim recheck, extending the #82 single-winner rule; the #82
adversarial harness stays 4/4. Additive, 1.x-compatible: optional persisted
identity fields, one new tool parameter, new response objects only.

## [1.101.0] - 2026-07-18 - Item A hardening: single winner, true ambiguity, order-independent identity (#82)

Adversarial QA by @rknighton reproduced four gaps in the 1.100.0 corpus
identity guarantees; all four are closed, verified by his supplied harness
(4/4). Creation claims now publish their ownership payload atomically (a
private temp file hardlinked into place), and a claim that exists without a
readable payload blocks creation with a new corpus_creation_in_progress
error instead of racing to a second physical index. Several equivalent
matches now always return bounded ambiguity with no established handle;
registry order never promotes a winner. Durable-selection identity is a
symmetric relation independent of creation order: an intentional named
subset and a full index are distinct corpora in either order, while a
temporary paths refresh remains a directional refresh rule only. Corpus-
shaping inputs (extra_ignore_patterns, follow_symlinks) are folded into the
durable-selection descriptor, and a refresh that changes coverage updates
identity and discloses it via corpus_selection_changed rather than
retargeting silently. Additive, 1.x-compatible.

## [1.100.0] - 2026-07-18 - corpus identity: index_local won't duplicate an equivalent source (#81)

Item A of the #80 identity meta-issue, spec by @rknighton. index_local now
resolves a structured corpus identity before choosing physical storage: the
normalized local root (the same resolve+normcase comparison doc_resolve_repo
uses) plus a durable documentation selection ("full", or a subset descriptor;
paths=["."] counts as full), persisted as DocIndex.corpus_selection. An
equivalent source with no conflicting explicit name reuses the established
handle; an explicit different name returns a corpus_already_indexed conflict
with no persistent write; several equivalent legacy indexes return bounded
ambiguity instead of guessing. A subset paths refresh never redefines the
durable selection, containment alone never establishes identity, and creation
sits behind an atomic claim so overlapping creations converge on one physical
index. Additive, 1.x-compatible, INDEX_VERSION unchanged.

## [1.99.0] - 2026-07-18 - doc_resolve_repo: path to doc-index handle lookup (#79)

Requested by @rknighton. New read-only doc_resolve_repo(path) answers "which
doc index covers this path?" via stored source_root metadata in an O(1)-sized
response: exact root match first, then the most specific containing root;
equally-specific duplicates return bounded ambiguity instead of guessing;
GitHub corpora (no source_root) never match. Suite parity with jCodeMunch's
resolve_repo; the doc_ prefix keeps the two servers collision-free. Tool
count 62 to 63. Additive, 1.x-compatible.

## [1.98.0] - 2026-07-16 - `watch` daemon: keep doc indexes fresh on any on-disk change (#78)

Reported by @oderwat. jDocMunch's index freshness rode entirely on the
PostToolUse hook, which only fires when the *agent* edits a doc file. Docs
changed outside the agent (a git pull, an editor, a build step, a teammate) went
stale until the agent happened to touch that file again. jCodeMunch has had a
`watch-all` daemon for this; jDocMunch now gets the equivalent, scoped to
documentation file types.

New foreground daemon `jdocmunch-mcp watch`: auto-discovers every locally-indexed
doc repo (registry-driven, via `list_repos`), watches each `source_root` with
`watchfiles`, filters to documentation extensions (`.md`/`.rst`/`.txt`/`.adoc`/
`.ipynb`/`.html`/... — the same `_DOC_EXTENSIONS` set the reindex hook uses), and
on any change re-indexes the owning index **incrementally** through the existing
`index_local(paths=[...])` subset path (jdoc#31 semantics: adds/updates listed
files, deletes a listed-but-missing file, never prunes unlisted docs). Repos
indexed while it runs are picked up on the next discovery pass; GitHub-sourced
indexes (no local source_root) are skipped. Clean SIGINT/SIGTERM shutdown; WSL
polling awareness (`JDOCMUNCH_WATCH_POLL_DELAY_MS`, mirrors jcm #356).

Background login service, same as jCodeMunch's: `jdocmunch-mcp watch-install`
registers the daemon as a per-user systemd unit / launchd LaunchAgent / Task
Scheduler task (`jdocmunch-watch`); `watch-uninstall` removes it; `watch-status`
prints service state + per-repo watch coverage. The daemon launches via
`sys.executable -m jdocmunch_mcp watch`, so a `__main__.py` entry point was added.

New agent-facing MCP tool `get_watch_status` (standard tier, read-only): reports
whether the login service is active and, per local doc repo, whether its
source_root still exists on disk (watchable). Tool count 61 -> 62.

New dependency `watchfiles>=0.21.0` (the only new runtime dep; the daemon fails
with a clear message if it's somehow absent).

**Disclosure:** README gains a "Background behavior, fully disclosed" section
(the file watcher, the opt-in login service, the existing hooks, telemetry, and
the local store) and drops "real-time file watching" from "Not intended for."
Additive, 1.x-compatible: no tool rename/removal, no `INDEX_VERSION` bump, no
wire change to existing tools. Tests: `tests/test_v1_98_0.py` (15) +
`tests/test_server.py` count/name updates.

### Added
- `jdocmunch-mcp watch` foreground daemon (`src/jdocmunch_mcp/watch.py`).
- `jdocmunch-mcp watch-install` / `watch-uninstall` / `watch-status` login-service
  commands (`src/jdocmunch_mcp/service_installer.py`).
- `get_watch_status` MCP tool (`src/jdocmunch_mcp/tools/get_watch_status.py`).
- `src/jdocmunch_mcp/__main__.py` so `python -m jdocmunch_mcp` works.
- `watchfiles>=0.21.0` runtime dependency; `JDOCMUNCH_WATCH_POLL_DELAY_MS` env var.

## [1.97.1] - 2026-07-16 - docs only

Documentation wording only. No code, wire-format, or behavior change from 1.97.0.

## [1.97.0] - 2026-07-16 - update model price constants to current Anthropic pricing

Updates the model input-price constants used by the `cost_avoided` dollar
estimate to Anthropic's current published rates: Opus $5/MTok, Sonnet $3/MTok,
Haiku $1/MTok. Anthropic has reduced input pricing across the Opus line since
these models launched, so the constants now track current pricing.

Token savings are measured in tokens and valued at the applicable model rate,
so the underlying savings are unchanged; only the price constants now reflect
current pricing.

### Changed
- `claude_opus` input rate set to the current $5/MTok (comment cites the dated
  source, anthropic.com/pricing 2026-06-24).

### Added
- `claude_sonnet` ($3/MTok) and `claude_haiku` ($1/MTok) entries, so
  `cost_avoided` / `total_cost_avoided` show the full current model set (parity
  with the sibling code MCP's price table). Additive keys only; the existing
  `claude_opus` and `gpt5_latest` keys are unchanged in name, so the wire shape
  stays 1.x-compatible.

`cost_avoided` does not touch the public token counter (which stores tokens and
values them at display time). No INDEX_VERSION bump, no tool add/rename. Suite
parity: jcm v1.108.130 (receipt table) + jdata v1.19.0 (same constants).

## [1.95.0] - 2026-07-10 - suite-parity retrieval verdict (`_meta.verdict` on search_sections + find_endpoint)

### Added

- **`search_sections` and `find_endpoint` now emit `_meta.verdict`** — the same
  agent-facing honesty contract the sibling code MCP ships on its search tools. An
  empty or weak result is positive, token-saving evidence: the index can attest
  "this topic is not documented here" instead of leaving the agent to reformulate
  a query for something that provably isn't present. Taxonomy: `ok` /
  `low_confidence` / `absent` / `degraded`.
- **`degraded`** fires when a caller requests semantic search on an index with no
  embeddings — results are lexical-only, so absence is not proven (re-index with
  embeddings for semantic recall). It takes precedence over `absent`.
- **`low_confidence`** keys off the existing retrieval confidence score (the
  documented < 0.4 ambiguity floor), so a returned-but-shaky top hit is flagged.
- **`absent`** carries a `did_you_mean` list of documents whose path or title
  contains a query term, so a miss redirects the agent instead of repeating.
  `find_endpoint` suggests existing endpoint paths that share a segment with a
  missed glob.

Clean-room jDoc implementation (new `retrieval/verdict.py`); only the wire shape
is shared with the sibling MCPs — no cross-suite import. Additive and
1.x-compatible: `_meta.verdict` is a new key, every existing response field is
unchanged, no `INDEX_VERSION` bump, inline compute (no new background or network
behavior). Tests: `tests/test_v1_95_0.py` (13).

## [1.94.0] - 2026-07-08 - large-corpus stability: vectors out of the monolith, throttled reindex hook, cheap list_repos (#75, #76, #77)

Reported by @floke75 (three linked issues, confirmed on two machines; a 16 GB
box suffered cascading jetsam kills / swap storm / WindowServer watchdog restarts
from the interaction of all three). Additive and 1.x-compatible: `INDEX_VERSION`
stays 3, no forced reindex — existing on-disk indexes keep working and drop their
inline vectors on the next save.

### Changed

- **#75 — embedding vectors live only in the sidecar, never inline in the index
  monolith.** `doc_store` persisted every section's vector inline in
  `~/.doc-index/<owner>/<name>.json`, pretty-printed at `indent=2` (~26 KB of JSON
  per 1024-dim section). On a broadly-indexed repo the monolith reached multiple
  GB and every `load_index` parsed the whole thing into Python lists — ~8 GB RSS
  and ~60 s on a 175k-section corpus, and the vectors were already duplicated in
  the `.embeddings.jsonl` cache. Fix: `_index_to_dict` strips the `embedding` key
  non-mutatingly (in-memory sections keep their vectors for the related/
  boilerplate/dedup sidecars built right after `save_index`), the monolith is
  written with compact `separators=(",", ":")` instead of `indent=2`, and vectors
  rehydrate lazily from the sidecar as `array('f')` (~4 KB per section, not ~70 KB
  as float lists) the first time a semantic code path needs them
  (`DocIndex._rehydrate_embeddings`, called from `_ensure_semantic_matrix`,
  `find_similar_sections`, `get_related_sections`, and the `get_doc_health`
  embedding count). `_has_embeddings` treats a present sidecar as "embeddings
  exist". A save-time safety net writes the sidecar first when sections carry
  vectors but none exists yet, so the strip is always lossless. `load_index` on a
  corpus this size drops from ~60 s / ~8 GB to sub-second / <0.5 GB with unchanged
  ranking (float32 shifts cosine ~1e-7, ordering unaffected outside exact ties).

- **#77 — `list_repos` no longer json-parses every monolith to take two
  `len()`s.** `DocStore.list_repos` (the documented first call of a session, also
  hit by the PreCompact snapshot hook) loaded every index monolith just to read
  `repo`/`indexed_at`/`doc_types` and `len(sections)`/`len(doc_paths)`. Each save
  now writes a tiny `<name>.summary.json` sidecar (atomically, inside the same
  per-repo write lock as the monolith), and `list_repos` reads it instead —
  falling back to the full parse for legacy indexes that predate the sidecar, and
  robust against a single corrupt monolith taking the whole listing down.
  `delete_index` removes the sidecar.

- **#76 — the PostToolUse auto-reindex hook is throttled.** `run_posttooluse`
  spawned one fire-and-forget `index-file` per Edit/Write with no lock, debounce,
  or spawn cap, so a burst of N edits fanned out into N concurrent full-index
  loads (the memory amplifier behind the crash). Now: a per-file leading-edge
  **debounce** (`JDOCMUNCH_HOOK_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS`, default 3 s) coalesces rapid
  repeat edits before anything spawns; the hook spawns a new throttled
  `hook-reindex` worker that acquires one of N cross-process **slot locks**
  (`JDOCMUNCH_HOOK_MAX_REINDEX`, default 2) *before* it loads the index and exits
  if the cap is saturated (the next edit reindexes — correctness holds); and an
  opt-in **breadcrumb log** (`JDOCMUNCH_HOOK_LOG=1` → `_hooks/reindex.log`) makes
  pile-ups/skips observable instead of silently discarded to `DEVNULL`. New
  `hook-reindex` CLI subcommand.

Tests: `tests/test_v1_94_0.py` (21); `tests/test_hooks.py` updated for the new
`hook-reindex` spawn target + a debounce-coalesce case.

## [1.93.0] - 2026-07-07 - MCP readOnlyHint annotations (suite parity with jcodemunch PR #361)

### Added

- **Every tool advertises `ToolAnnotations(readOnlyHint=...)`.** MCP clients that
  gate execution (Claude Code plan mode) prompted for approval on every jDoc
  call because tools carried no annotations. Read tools are now
  `readOnlyHint=True` (plan mode runs them silently) and the write-set is
  `False`. Applied at the `list_tools` chokepoint via a non-mutating
  `model_copy`. The write-set (`index_local`, `doc_index_repo`, `delete_index`,
  `define_repo_group`, `tune_weights`, `check_embedding_drift`) is any tool that
  can mutate persistent state under any argument — biased conservative, since
  mislabeling a writer as read-only is the harmful direction. Suite parity with
  jcodemunch-mcp (PR #361) and jdatamunch-mcp. Additive, 1.x-compatible (new
  `tools/list` field only). Tests: `tests/test_v1_93_0.py` (4).

## [1.70.2] - 2026-06-12 - search/verify/event-loop fixes (#32, #33, #34)

Patch release closing the remaining three issues from @mmashwani's
2026-06-11/12 report batch (the first, #31, shipped in v1.70.1).

**#32 - `search_sections` `path_glob` now pre-filters candidates.**
The glob was a tool-layer post-filter applied AFTER the index-layer top-k
cut (only `role` triggered candidate over-fetch), so a glob naming a single
document returned 0 results with confidence 0.0 whenever that document
didn't rank in the corpus-wide top k - near-certain on large corpora.
`DocStore.search` gains a `path_glob` parameter applied as a candidate
pre-filter in all three modes (lexical, semantic, hybrid) alongside the
existing `doc_path` equality check, via a shared `_path_excluded` helper;
the tool-layer post-filter is removed. Ranking now happens within the
glob-matched set, as documented.

**#33 - `verify_index` accounts for unverifiable sections.**
Sections persisted with an empty byte range (`byte_end <= byte_start`) were
skipped with a bare `continue`, so the failure counters didn't sum to
`section_count` and hundreds of unverifiable sections (e.g. every section
from the structured OpenAPI parser) read as a fully clean index. New
`skipped_count` and `skipped_sections` (reason `"empty_byte_range"`) close
the arithmetic; the invariant `clean + drift + missing + error + skipped ==
section_count` is now tested. The docstring's stale promise to route these
into `missing_sections` is corrected: unverifiable-by-design is a distinct
signal from corruption.

**#34 - `index_local` no longer blocks the MCP event loop.**
The full index + embed pipeline ran synchronously inside the async
`call_tool` handler, monopolizing the server's single asyncio loop past
client tool timeouts; once the client timed out, every subsequent call also
timed out while the server kept working. `index_local` now dispatches via
`asyncio.to_thread`, so cheap tools (`doc_list_repos`, `search_sections`)
stay responsive during long indexing runs. The v1.69.2 cross-process
index-write lock already serializes concurrent same-repo writes. The
larger suggestions from #34 (background job + progress polling, vectorized
cosine scoring) are acknowledged and deliberately deferred.

Additive per the 1.x contract: new defaulted kwarg on `DocStore.search`,
new response keys on `verify_index`, no tool or wire-shape removals.
Regression tests in `tests/test_v1_70_2.py`.

## [1.70.1] - 2026-06-12 - `paths` subset refresh no longer prunes the rest of the index (#31)

Patch release. Fixes a data-loss bug reported by @mmashwani in #31:
`index_local(paths=[...])` (and CLI `index-local --paths-from FILE`) on an
existing incremental index treated every indexed file NOT in the list as
deleted. A refresh of 1-3 changed files collapsed a whole corpus — e.g.
176 files / ~2957 sections reduced to the listed file's 11 sections —
directly contradicting the documented intent of `paths` ("batch-indexing
exactly the files an agent already knows about").

Root cause: `paths` only narrowed which files were read into
`current_files`; `DocStore.detect_changes` then computed deletions as
`old_set - new_set` against the full existing index, so every unlisted
file was pruned by `incremental_save`.

Fix, in `tools/index_local.py`: when `paths` is provided on the
incremental path, the deletion diff is scoped to the requested subset.
Listed files are added/updated; a listed file that no longer exists on
disk is removed; files under a listed directory are diffed against that
subtree; indexed files outside the listed subset are never touched.
Listing the corpus root (`.`) keeps the full-corpus diff, and the
walk-based (no-`paths`) path is unchanged. A subset refresh can now also
process pure deletions (every listed file gone from disk) instead of
failing with "No documentation files found"; that error still applies
when there is no existing index to update.

Additive per the 1.x contract: no tool/response shape changes; the only
behavioral change removes an undocumented destructive side effect.
Regression tests in `tests/test_v1_70_1.py`.

## [1.70.0] - 2026-06-11 - recency window on weight tuning

`tune_weights` now learns from a recency window of the ranking ledger
instead of the lifetime history. New `max_age_days` parameter (default 90;
`0` restores the lifetime read) on the MCP tool, `tune_one_repo`, and
`tune_all_repos`; `ranking_db_query` gains a `window_seconds` filter to
support it.

Previously every ranking event ever recorded for a repo fed the
`semantic_weight` proposal, so as a doc corpus and its query patterns
drifted, stale events kept anchoring the learned weight to a distribution
that no longer exists. Recent research on memory systems documents exactly
this failure mode: accumulated context that can't distinguish current from
stale signal degrades retrieval quality over time. Mirrors jcodemunch-mcp
v1.108.53.

Additive per the 1.x contract: new defaulted kwargs and new response keys
(`max_age_days` on tuner results) only; existing call shapes keep working.

## [1.69.2] - 2026-06-10 - serialize concurrent same-repo index writes (PR #28)

Patch release. Fixes a data race when two processes write the same repo's
index at once (e.g. a scheduled reindex and a per-edit hook). Originally
contributed by @Chrisr6records; the cross-platform lock and the Windows
replace-retry were added here to carry it across the finish line.

jdocmunch rewrites the whole `<name>.json` on every save. The two writers
both wrote a shared deterministic `<name>.json.tmp` and then `os.replace`-d
it into place with no lock, so concurrent writers could install corrupt or
partial JSON (the repo then reads as both "corrupt" and "absent") or silently
lose an update (last-replace-wins on the read-modify-write in
`incremental_save`).

Fix, in `storage/doc_store.py`:
- **Per-PID temp name** (`<name>.json.<pid>.tmp`) so concurrent writers never
  share, and clobber, one temp file.
- **Cross-process write lock** around `save_index` / `incremental_save` (the
  whole read-modify-write), backed by `flock` on POSIX and `msvcrt.locking`
  on Windows, on a per-repo `<name>.json.lock`. This is what closes the
  lost-update window, on both platforms.
- **Bounded replace-retry** (`_atomic_replace`): on Windows a concurrent
  reader holding the destination open makes `os.replace` raise
  `PermissionError` (WinError 5/32) transiently; a brief backoff rides it out,
  then re-raises the original error if it never clears. POSIX `rename` is
  atomic and never hits this.
- `delete_index` cleans up the per-repo `.lock` file.

The PR's original lock was POSIX-only (`fcntl`), which no-op'd on Windows and
left both the lost-update race and the `os.replace` `WinError 5` unfixed
there; both are now covered. Fully additive: no `INDEX_VERSION` change, no
tool/response change, and the default failure mode is unchanged (the retry
never introduces a new raise -- 1.x contract). New regression tests in
`tests/test_concurrent_index_writes.py` reproduce both races across real
processes and pass on Windows and POSIX.

## [1.69.1] - 2026-06-10 - redirect git subprocess stdin to DEVNULL (PR #30)

Patch release. Fixes a Windows-only deadlock that wedged the MCP stdio
server permanently on any `index_local` call. Contributed by @Derjyn.

`_git` and `_git_bytes` spawned git with `stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL`
but left `stdin` un-redirected. Under the MCP stdio transport the git
child inherited the server's stdin, which is the JSON-RPC pipe from the
client; Git for Windows blocked on that inherited handle and never
exited. The `JDOCMUNCH_GIT_TIMEOUT` guard couldn't recover: the timeout
killed the direct child, but the post-kill `communicate()` drain then
blocked forever joining the reader thread because the `cmd\git.exe`
wrapper chain still held the inherited pipe handles. The event loop
wedged inside the synchronous tool call.

The CLI `index-local` path never hung because its stdin is a console
handle, not a pipe, which made the bug look transport-specific. Both git
and non-git target folders hung (a non-git folder still calls
`local_git_head` -> `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`).

Fix: pass `stdin=subprocess.DEVNULL` in both helpers. Pure no-op for
behavior; none of the spawned git commands (`rev-parse`,
`status --porcelain`, `ls-files`) read stdin. With the patch the same
stdio harness calls complete in 0.1-0.6s.

## [1.66.3] - 2026-05-16 - openai-compatible: probe actual dim at init (jdoc#20)

Patch release. Hardens the openai-compatible provider added in v1.66.0.

## The silent-corruption window

`_OpenAICompatibleProvider` returned `(f"{url}::{model}", None)` from
`_provider_identity()` because the embedding dim was unknown without
calling the endpoint. The on-disk cache (`embeddings/cache.py`) handles
`dim=None` by relaxing the strict dim check to a wildcard.

That composes correctly when the backing model stays put. But if a user
keeps the URL/model env vars constant and swaps the backing model behind
the endpoint -- a realistic Ollama scenario, retagging
`nomic-embed-text` to point at `all-minilm` -- the cache identity still
matches, and old 768-dim vectors get mixed with fresh 384-dim vectors.
Downstream cosine math either crashes on shape mismatch or silently
returns garbage similarity scores.

## The fix

`_OpenAICompatibleProvider.__init__` now embeds a one-token canary at
construction time to discover the endpoint's actual embedding dim, and
stores it on `self.dim`. `_provider_identity("openai-compatible")` reads
that dim out of the cached provider singleton. The cache layer's strict
dim check now engages and a silent backing-model swap forces a clean
re-embed.

Probe failure is non-fatal: `self.dim` stays `None`, the cache layer
falls back to its wildcard-dim behavior (v1.66.0 semantics). Network
outage, misbehaved endpoint, or any other probe error degrades
gracefully.

Cost: one extra round-trip on provider init (per process), once per
session. Cheap.

## Tests

3 new regression tests in `tests/test_openai_compatible_embeddings.py`:
probe-discovers-actual-dim, probe-failure-sets-dim-none, and
identity-uses-probed-dim-when-instance-cached. The four existing tests
that assert on the fake client's `.calls` list were updated to account
for the probe as the first recorded call (skipping `calls[0]` or
asserting the probe explicitly).

Full suite: 1254 passing.

## Cross-suite

When jcm and jdata pick up the openai-compatible provider (jcm#302,
jdata#2), the same probe-at-init pattern should ship in those ports.

## [1.66.2] - 2026-05-16 - warm sentence-transformers before stdio (jdoc#19)

Patch release. Reported by @rknighton on jdoc#19.

The first semantic `search_sections` call hung when sentence-transformers
was the configured provider. The model lazy-loads on first `embed_query`,
and that load (a) can exceed the MCP client's tool-call timeout and
(b) writes progress/download chatter to stdout, corrupting MCP JSON-RPC
framing. Same call worked from a direct Python entry point because
nothing was contending for stdout.

Fix: warm the active embedding provider in `run_server()` before
entering `stdio_server()`. `provider.warmup()` is gated on provider
type -- only sentence-transformers gets warmed (it's the only one
with significant cold-start latency and stdout-leak risk); network
providers (gemini, openai, openai-compatible) are skipped to avoid
an avoidable startup round-trip. The warmup runs inside a
`contextlib.redirect_stdout(sys.stderr)` so any noisy library writes
land somewhere safe.

Warmup failure is non-fatal: server still starts, the first real
embed call retries cleanly.

Regression coverage in `tests/test_hybrid_search.py` (4 new tests):
network providers skip warmup, unconfigured provider skips warmup,
sentence-transformers gets warmed, exception during warmup is
swallowed. Full suite: 1251 passing.

## [1.66.1] - 2026-05-16 - `should_embed("false")` now parses as False (jdoc#18)

Patch release. Reported by @rknighton on jdoc#18.

`should_embed(flag)` resolved any non-empty string via `bool(flag)`, so
`use_embeddings="false"` evaluated to `True` and silently turned
embeddings on. MCP tool inputs that arrive over the wire as JSON strings
(`"false"`, `"0"`, `"no"`) all hit this path.

Fix: recognise common string booleans (case-insensitive, whitespace-
trimmed) before the `bool()` fallback. Recognised truthy: `"true"`,
`"1"`, `"yes"`, `"on"`, `"t"`, `"y"`. Recognised falsy: `"false"`,
`"0"`, `"no"`, `"off"`, `"f"`, `"n"`, `""`. `"auto"` behavior preserved.

Unknown strings still fall through to `bool(flag)` to preserve 1.x
compatibility: a typo like `"flase"` remains truthy as it did before,
rather than silently disabling embeddings. The contract is "we
recognise the obvious cases; we don't change behavior for inputs we
don't recognise."

Regression coverage in `tests/test_hybrid_search.py` (3 new tests, 19
total in that file). Full suite: 1247 passing.

## [1.66.0] - 2026-05-16 - openai-compatible embeddings (PR #17)

Adds opt-in `openai-compatible` embedding provider for any
OpenAI-API-shaped endpoint (Ollama, vLLM, LiteLLM, llama.cpp,
LM Studio, etc.). Contributed by @DevItBetter via PR #17.

Four new env vars, all opt-in, no default-behavior change:

- `JDOCMUNCH_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai-compatible` (required to activate)
- `JDOCMUNCH_OPENAI_COMPAT_URL` (required when active)
- `JDOCMUNCH_OPENAI_COMPAT_MODEL` (required when active)
- `JDOCMUNCH_OPENAI_COMPAT_API_KEY` (optional, defaults to literal
  `"local"`; never falls back to `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- `JDOCMUNCH_OPENAI_COMPAT_BATCH_SIZE` (optional, default 32)

Design highlights worth preserving:

1. **Explicit-only activation.** Never auto-detected. Setting only the
   URL/model without the provider env var returns `None` from
   `get_provider_name()`.
2. **Credential isolation.** Default API key is the literal `"local"`,
   never falls through to `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Closes the bug class where
   a real OpenAI key could leak to a localhost endpoint.
3. **Cache signature** includes URL, model, first-8 of compat key, and
   batch size. Ambient `OPENAI_API_KEY` is excluded.
4. **Provider identity** returns `(f"{url}::{model}", None)`; cache
   layer relaxes the dim check when dim is unknown.

Test coverage in `tests/test_openai_compatible_embeddings.py` (16 tests,
304 lines): provider selection, missing-config handling,
non-auto-detection, credential isolation, batch-size defaults +
overrides + invalid fallback, signature variance, identity, and both
query-cache and section-cache invalidation on model change.

Follow-ups filed: jdoc#20 (pin actual dim via canary at provider init
to close a silent backing-model-swap corruption window),
jcm#302 + jdata#2 (sibling-parity ports).

## [1.65.0] - 2026-05-14 - prefer-newest walk order on truncation (jdoc#16)

Follow-up to jdoc#15 (@LuigiNicaPRO). When the corpus exceeds `max_files`
and truncation kicks in, the previous walker took the first `max_files`
in filesystem-walk order -- non-deterministic from the user's
perspective. A file edited 4 minutes before the index call could be
silently dropped while older files made the cut. Reported by
@LuigiNicaPRO as suggestion #4 on jdoc#15; deferred to its own ship.

New `sort_by` kwarg on `index_local` and `discover_doc_files`:

- `sort_by="newest"` **(new default):** when `discovered > max_files`,
  sorts by mtime descending so the indexed subset is always the N
  most recently-edited files. Recent edits are always in the index
  regardless of filesystem-walk position.
- `sort_by="walk_order"`: pre-1.65 behavior. Useful for deterministic
  reproducible builds where mtimes shift but content doesn't.

The sort only runs on the truncation path (`discovered > max_files`),
so corpora under the cap pay zero cost. mtime is captured in the same
`stat()` call that already does the size check, so no extra syscalls
either.

Regression coverage in `tests/test_index_local_sort_by.py` (6 tests).

## [1.64.2] - 2026-05-14 - silent truncation footgun in `index_local` (jdoc#15)

Reported by @LuigiNicaPRO: `index_local()` on a 5,705-file Obsidian Vault
returned `success: true` and `file_count: 498` with no programmatic
signal that ~90% of the corpus had been silently dropped. Default
`max_files=500` was buried in the schema; the cap-hit hint was a
free-text `note` string in the response.

Four fixes:

1. **Default `max_files` raised from 500 to 10,000.** Modern doc repos
   and Obsidian Vaults routinely exceed 500.
2. **Walker counts past the cap** (up to a 20x safety ceiling) so
   `discovered` reflects the true corpus size, not the cap. Returns a
   new tuple shape `(files, warnings, discovered_count)`.
3. **Structured top-level truncation fields**: when the cap is hit, the
   response now includes `truncated: true`, `discovered: <total>`,
   `indexed: <max_files>`. Programmatic detection is trivial:
   `if result.get("truncated"):`. When the corpus fits, `truncated:
   false` is set explicitly.
4. **Structured warning entry** in the existing `warnings` array
   alongside the legacy `note` string (kept for back-compat).

Both the full-index and incremental code paths surface the new fields.

Walker order is still filesystem order -- prefer-newest is a useful
future enhancement (@LuigiNicaPRO's suggestion #4) but lands cleanest
in a separate ship since it changes which subset gets indexed, not
just how truncation is reported.

Regression coverage in `tests/test_index_local_truncation.py` (6 tests).

## [1.64.1] - 2026-05-14 - O(N^2) hang in `related_persist.build()` (jdoc#14)

Reported by @LuigiNicaPRO with a py-spy backtrace and a working local
patch in hand: `index_local` on a 10-20k-section repo hung at 100% CPU
on a single thread. The docstring claimed `build()` was O(N) on
structural edges; it was actually O(N^2) on two stacked patterns:

1. `section_dicts` was rebuilt inside the per-section loop on every
   iteration -- O(N) work x N iterations = O(N^2) before any neighbor
   computation began.
2. `structural_neighbors()` rebuilt its by-id map and called
   `_children_of(parent_id, sections)` up to 4 times per section, each
   a linear scan -- another O(N) per outer iteration.

Fix: precompute `section_dicts`, the by-id map, and a new
parent->children map once before the loop and thread them into the
per-section calls via two new optional kwargs on `structural_neighbors`
and `semantic_neighbors`. External callers ignore the new kwargs and
keep the original behavior bit-for-bit -- the cache parameters are
prefixed `_` to mark them as internal hot-path use only.

Bench (Windows / Python 3.14): the fixed path indexes 10k sections in
~0.6s. The pre-fix path on the same input ran for minutes before being
killed.

Regression coverage in `tests/test_related_persist_perf.py`: asserts
the build scales linearly between 2k and 4k sections (ratio <3.5x) and
that 15k completes in <5s.

## [1.64.0] - 2026-05-14 - `tool_profile` + `disabled_tools` config (#297)

Reported by @AlexJ-StL in #297: Google Antigravity caps MCP-server tool
counts at 50, but jdocmunch shipped 60 tools with no way to trim them
short of disabling the whole server. Sibling-parity gap with jcm, which
has had `tool_profile` and `disabled_tools` since v1.78.

Two new env-var-driven knobs in `server.py`:

- `JDOCMUNCH_TOOL_PROFILE=core|standard|full` (default `full`).
  - `core` (13 tools): index + the navigation/search essentials.
  - `standard` (~50 tools): core + analysis/cross-reference tools.
  - `full` (60 tools): everything, current behavior.
- `JDOCMUNCH_DISABLED_TOOLS=tool1,tool2,...` removes named tools from
  both the listed schema and the call dispatcher. Composes with
  `tool_profile`.

Filtering is enforced in `list_tools()` (schema visibility) AND
`call_tool()` (call-time rejection) so a client that cached the schema
gets a clear error if it invokes a disabled tool. `jdocmunch_guide`
survives tier filtering (so a one-line CLAUDE.md keeps working at any
tier) but honors `disabled_tools` (it's documentation, not a control
surface) -- mirrors jcm v1.108.8's issue-#298 resolution.

Antigravity users with the full munch suite can now run:

```jsonc
// per-server env vars
"jdocmunch": { "env": { "JDOCMUNCH_TOOL_PROFILE": "core" } }
```

to fit under the 50-tool cap.

## [1.63.3] - 2026-05-13 - `jdocmunch_guide` sibling-parity tool

Adds `jdocmunch_guide` -- the doc-MCP sibling of `jcodemunch_guide` (jcm
since v1.84.0). Returns the version-current CLAUDE.md / AGENT.md policy
snippet for jdocmunch-mcp so an agent can keep a one-line CLAUDE.md
(`"Call jdocmunch_guide and strictly follow its instructions."`) instead
of pasting a static block that drifts from the installed version.

Backstory: GitHub issue #296 (Codex Desktop compatibility report by
@rknighton) noted that jcodemunch-mcp ships a guide tool but jdocmunch-mcp
doesn't, leaving agents told to call `<pkg>_guide first` without an
onboarding entry point for the doc surface. Sibling parity closes the
gap. Companion v1.12.2 release of jdatamunch-mcp ships `jdatamunch_guide`
on the same shape.

Tool count 59 -> 60. No tool, schema, or wire-format change for existing
tools. 1205 tests pass (1199 + 6 new in `test_v1_63_3.py`).

## [1.63.2] - 2026-05-12 - drift-proof __version__ via importlib.metadata

`src/jdocmunch_mcp/__init__.py` now derives `__version__` from
`importlib.metadata.version("jdocmunch-mcp")` instead of a hardcoded
literal. Reads the wheel's metadata at import time, so pyproject.toml
and the runtime version string can no longer disagree by construction.

Backstory: v1.63.0 shipped with the hardcoded `__version__` stuck at
1.60.0 (three minors stale) because nothing cross-checked it against
pyproject. v1.63.1 added a `tests/test_version_sync.py` regex guard,
but jcodemunch-mcp already had a better pattern. This release ports
that pattern over and retires the test (no longer reachable code).

When run from a source checkout without pip install, `__version__`
resolves to `"unknown"`. The replay-runner's `_resolve_version()`
already falls back to parsing `pyproject.toml` in that case, so
baseline-result filenames stay correct on source builds.

No tool, schema, or wire-format changes.

## [1.63.1] - 2026-05-12 - CI green: fixture query rename + full-history checkout

Patch release that turns master green again. Two independent CI fixes,
no behavior change for installed users.

1. Replay fixture: the `wiki stats` query in `self_v1_11_0.json` collided
   with the `### Stats` H3 subheadings that v1.62.0 and v1.63.0 hand-added
   to CHANGELOG.md. BM25 ranked those short, dense sections above the
   target wiki-benchmark page, dropping MRR from 1.0 to 0.925 (over the
   0.06 gate). Renamed to `wiki benchmark`. Expected target returns to
   rank 1 with a clean margin and the slug `jdocmunch-mcp-wiki-benchmark`
   is the unambiguous lexical anchor for it.
2. Workflow checkout: both `test.yml` and `replay.yml` now set
   `fetch-depth: 0` on `actions/checkout@v5`. The shallow default broke
   `tests/test_v1_35_0.py::TestChangelogGenerator::test_runs_against_real_repo`
   on any push whose HEAD wasn't itself a `release:` commit, because
   `scripts/generate_changelog.py` walks `git log` for release subjects
   and a depth-1 clone had none to match.

No tool, schema, or wire-format changes. v1.63.1 baseline result captured
at `benchmarks/replay/results/self_v1_11_0-v1.63.1.json` (1.0 / 1.0 / 1.0).

## [1.63.0] — 2026-05-12 — `get_doc_pr_risk_profile` (Phase-2 sibling-parity COMPLETE)

Composite doc-PR risk profile. Fuses five orthogonal signals over a
caller-supplied list of changed sections into a 0-1 `risk_score` with
overall `risk_level` (low / medium / high / critical), a ranked top-5
list of blockers, and a one-line `recommended_action`. Mirrors jcm's
`get_pr_risk_profile`.

### Signals

| Signal                | Source                                              |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `volume`              | changed sections / total sections (×10 cap)         |
| `blast_radius`        | mean blast_score for modified + deleted sections    |
| `backlink_burden`     | avg inbound references per changed section / 5     |
| `tutorial_disruption` | % of changes on tutorial chains                     |
| `role_weight`         | % of changes hitting tutorial/reference/guide roles |

Weights: `volume 0.15 + blast 0.30 + backlinks 0.20 + tutorial 0.20 + role 0.15`.
Thresholds: `≤0.25 low / ≤0.50 medium / ≤0.75 high / >0.75 critical`.

### Input shape

Caller passes `changed_sections` as either bare section IDs (str,
defaults to `kind=modified`) or `{section_id, kind}` dicts where
`kind ∈ {added, modified, deleted}`. Added sections skip backlink
lookup since they cannot have inbound refs yet.

The tool does **not** diff anything itself — pair with `get_recent_changes`
or compute the list from `git diff` in your CI step.

### Stats

- Tool count: 59 (+ `get_doc_pr_risk_profile`)
- Tests: 1196 passed (+12 new — 5 pure-function + 7 integration)

This completes Phase 2 of the sibling-parity PRD across all three munches.

## [1.62.0] — 2026-05-12 — `doc_health_radar` + `diff_doc_health_radar`

Six-axis health radar for documentation indexes, plus a pure-function
diff helper. Third leg of the suite-wide radar pattern (jcm's
`health_radar.py` + jData's `data_health_radar`).

### Axes

Each axis scores 0-100 (higher = healthier):

| Axis                | Source                                              |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `freshness`           | fresh / (fresh + edited + stale) × 100            |
| `link_integrity`      | linear penalty per broken link (relative to sections) |
| `orphan_health`       | linear penalty per orphan section                 |
| `embedding_coverage`  | embedded sections / total sections × 100          |
| `role_coverage`       | sections with non-unknown role / total × 100      |
| `drift_health`        | canary clean → 100; alarm → 0; no canary → omitted|

`freshness` is omitted when section_count is zero. `drift_health` is
omitted when no embedding-drift canary has been captured. Omitted axes
appear in `omitted_axes` and never silently penalise the composite —
radars stay comparable across repos with different setup states.

### `diff_doc_health_radar`

Pure function: takes two radar payloads, returns per-axis deltas,
composite delta, grade change, regression + improvement lists at a
3-point threshold, and a one-line verdict. No I/O.

### Stats

- Tool count: 58 (+ `doc_health_radar`, `diff_doc_health_radar`)
- Tests: 1184 passed (+12 new; 12 pre-existing baseline-gate failures unaffected)

---

## [1.61.0] — 2026-05-12

### New: explicit-paths indexing

`index_local` gains a `paths=[...]` parameter that bypasses the directory
walk and indexes only the listed files / subdirs. Each entry can be
absolute or relative to the `path` root. Useful for batch-indexing
exactly the doc files an agent already knows about — e.g. *the docs git
just touched*, *the pages in this PR's diff*, *the markdown matched by
fd / rg* — without the cost (or surprise) of a full-tree walk.

Security: explicit paths are validated the same way as walk-discovered
files — entries outside the root, path-traversal attempts, and symlink
escapes are rejected with per-entry `warnings`. Unsupported extensions
are warned-and-skipped rather than silently passed.

CLI: new `--paths-from FILE` flag on `jdocmunch-mcp index-local`. Use
`-` for stdin to make the command pipe-friendly with `find`, `fd`,
`fzf`, and `rg`:

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD~5 -- '*.md' \
  | jdocmunch-mcp index-local --path docs/ --paths-from -
```

Empty input is treated as an error so the command doesn't silently fall
through to a full-tree index. Lines beginning with `#` are skipped.

### Notes
- Fully additive — `paths` defaults to `None`, preserving every existing
  call shape. The MCP `index_local` tool's `inputSchema` gains an
  optional `paths: list[string]` field with the same semantics.

## [1.60.0] — 2026-05-11

### New: `find_similar_sections` — multi-signal dedup detection

Every wiki of size accumulates "three pages that all say the same
thing." This tool surfaces them. Multi-signal scoring fuses embedding
cosine (when the index has embeddings) with title + body lexical
Jaccard, gated by a cheap title-token pre-filter to keep cost bounded
on large wikis.

Output is cluster-shaped: one entry per group of overlapping sections,
each with a `canonical` (recommended keeper, ranked by backlink_count +
byte_length) and `variants` to fold in. Verdict tiers per cluster:

- `near_duplicate` — combined score ≥ `near_duplicate_threshold` (0.92)
- `overlapping_topic` — combined score ∈ `[min_score, threshold)`
- `parallel_tutorial` — cluster members live in different doc
  directories (suggests parallel guides that should cross-reference
  rather than be merged)

Defaults: `min_score=0.7`, `max_clusters=50`, `max_sections=1000`.
Parser-artifact filter drops zero-byte-range wrapper sections so they
don't cluster with their own heading-level twins.

Read-only. Inspired by `find_similar_symbols` in jcodemunch-mcp (see
`C:/MCPs/PRD_sibling_parity_v1.md` §6.2). **Completes the jDoc Phase-1
batch from the sibling-parity PRD** (joins `check_section_delete_safe`
+ `get_section_blast_radius`).

### New: `get_section_blast_radius` — transitive impact of a section change

Companion to `get_backlinks` (which is depth 1 only). Walks the inbound
reference graph to `max_depth` (default 3) and classifies each hit as
`anchor` (link targets this section's slug), `doc` (link targets the
enclosing doc), or `tutorial` (section appears in a Next/Prev / toctree
chain).

Returns `direct_impact` (depth 1), `transitive_impact` (depth ≥ 2), a
`summary` of counts, and a normalised `blast_score` in [0, 1] so blast
radius is comparable across sections of different size.

Read-only. Inspired by `get_blast_radius` in jcodemunch-mcp (see
`C:/MCPs/PRD_sibling_parity_v1.md` §6.3).

### New: `check_section_delete_safe` — composite deletion preflight

First Phase-1 deliverable from the sibling-parity PRD. Answers the
question every wiki maintainer asks every week: *can I safely remove
this section?*

Fuses four channels into a single verdict plus up to five ranked
blockers and a one-line `recommended_action`:

1. **Tutorial-path membership** — section is part of a Next/Prev chain,
   Sphinx toctree, VuePress sidebar, or ordered-filename sequence. High
   severity — deleting breaks readers walking the chain.
2. **Anchor-specific backlinks** — other sections link to `doc#slug`.
   High severity — those anchored links 404 once the section is gone.
3. **Transitive doc-level backlinks** — BFS over inbound refs to
   `transitive_depth` (default 3). Medium severity above a threshold of
   3 referers.
4. **Recent-edit recency** — section's source touched within
   `recent_edit_days` (default 14), or sits in FreshnessProbe's
   `edited_uncommitted` bucket. Low severity — defer deletion.

Verdict tiers (highest first): `tutorial_path_blocking`,
`anchor_referenced`, `backlinks_blocking`, `recently_edited_blocking`,
`safe_to_delete`.

Read-only. Composes existing primitives (`get_tutorial_path`,
`get_backlinks`, `FreshnessProbe`) — no new persisted state, no
INDEX_VERSION bump.

Inspired by `check_delete_safe` in jcodemunch-mcp (see
`C:/MCPs/PRD_sibling_parity_v1.md` §6.1).

## [1.9.0] — 2026-04-19

### New: Hybrid BM25 + semantic search

- **`search_sections` now fuses lexical and semantic scores** when the index has embeddings. New parameters match jcodemunch-mcp's shape:
  - `semantic` — `null`/omit (auto — hybrid when embeddings exist), `true` (force hybrid), `false` (force lexical-only)
  - `semantic_only` — skip lexical entirely, rank purely by embedding cosine
  - `semantic_weight` — 0.0–1.0 weight of the semantic channel in fusion (default 0.5)
- Each channel min-max-normalized to [0,1] within the candidate set, then weighted sum. When `embed_query` returns `None` (provider disabled at query time), hybrid gracefully degrades to lexical. Zero performance impact when the index has no embeddings.
- `_meta.search_mode` now reports one of `hybrid`, `semantic_only`, or `lexical` (replacing the previous binary `semantic`/`lexical`). `_meta.semantic_weight` is surfaced on hybrid calls.

### New: `use_embeddings="auto"` default

- `index_local` and `doc_index_repo` now default `use_embeddings` to `"auto"` — embeddings are generated automatically whenever an embedding provider is configured (`GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or sentence-transformers installed). Explicit `true`/`false` still honored.
- `index-file` now preserves embedding parity: when re-indexing a single file into an index that already has embeddings, the new sections get embedded too (previously left empty).

### Tests

- 16 new tests covering `should_embed` flag resolution, hybrid fusion ranking, `semantic=False` short-circuit, semantic-only, `semantic_weight=0` reduction to lexical, graceful degradation, and search_mode reporting (400 total).

## [1.8.1] — 2026-04-15

### Documentation
- **Hermes Agent integration** — added "Works with" section to README with Hermes Agent config example; submitted optional skill PR to [NousResearch/hermes-agent#10413](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/10413)

## [1.7.1] — 2026-04-09

### New features

- **`meta_fields` support** — control which `_meta` fields appear in tool responses via `JDOCMUNCH_META_FIELDS` env var. Matches jcodemunch-mcp's `meta_fields` affordance. Values: unset/`[]` = strip `_meta` entirely (default, maximum token savings), `null`/`all`/`*` = include all fields, comma-separated list = include only those fields (e.g. `timing_ms,powered_by`).

### Tests

- 11 new tests for meta_fields config parsing and filtering (358 total)

## [1.7.0] — 2026-04-09

### New: Full `init` onboarding

- **`jdocmunch-mcp init`** — One-command setup matching jcodemunch-mcp's UX:
  - Detects installed MCP clients (Claude Code CLI, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Continue)
  - Patches each client's config JSON to add jdocmunch as an MCP server
  - Installs a Doc Exploration Policy into CLAUDE.md (global or project scope)
  - Installs Cursor rules (`.cursor/rules/jdocmunch.mdc`) and Windsurf rules (`.windsurfrules`)
  - Installs enforcement hooks (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, PreCompact)
  - Indexes the current working directory
  - Supports `--dry-run`, `--demo`, `--yes`, `--no-backup`, `--client`, `--claude-md`, `--hooks`, `--index`
  - Interactive prompts for scope selection when run in a terminal

### New: `claude-md` subcommand

- **`jdocmunch-mcp claude-md`** — Print the Doc Exploration Policy to stdout
- **`jdocmunch-mcp claude-md --install global|project`** — Append policy to CLAUDE.md (idempotent)

### New: `index-file` single-file re-index

- **`jdocmunch-mcp index-file <path>`** — Re-index a single doc file within an existing index without re-walking the entire folder. Finds the owning index automatically, re-parses, and updates in place via incremental_save.
- PostToolUse hook now spawns `index-file <path>` instead of `index-local --path <dir>` for faster, more targeted re-indexing after edits.

### Tests

- 20 new tests for client detection, config patching, CLAUDE.md injection, Cursor/Windsurf rules, claude-md command, index-file tool, CLI dispatch (347 total)

## [1.6.0] — 2026-04-09

### New: CLI hook system for Claude Code

- **`hook-pretooluse`** — PreToolUse hook that intercepts `Read` on large doc files (.md, .rst, .adoc, .txt, etc.) and suggests `search_sections` + `get_section` instead. Warns via stderr; allows the read to proceed (Edit workflow requires Read first).
- **`hook-posttooluse`** — PostToolUse hook that auto-reindexes after `Edit`/`Write` on doc files. Spawns `jdocmunch-mcp index-local` as a fire-and-forget background process.
- **`hook-precompact`** — PreCompact hook that generates a session snapshot (indexed repos, doc/section counts) before Claude Code context compaction, injected as `systemMessage`.
- **`index-local --path <dir>`** — CLI equivalent of the MCP `index_local` tool, callable from shell hooks without a live MCP session.
- **`init --hooks`** — One-command installer that merges all three enforcement hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json`. Additive (preserves existing hooks), creates `.bak` backup by default. Supports `--dry-run`.

### Fixed

- Version mismatch between `__init__.py` and `pyproject.toml` — both now track 1.6.0.

### Tests

- 29 new tests for hooks + init (327 total)

Closes [#8](https://github.com/jgravelle/jdocmunch-mcp/issues/8). Thanks @Will-Luck for the detailed feature request.

## [1.5.3] — 2026-04-07

### Changed
- Switch MCP tool responses from pretty-printed JSON to compact JSON — saves 30-40% tokens per response (jcodemunch-mcp#219)

## [1.5.2] — 2026-04-06

### Added
- **`contrib/build-deb.sh`** — Community-contributed Debian/Ubuntu packaging script for Proxmox and other Linux deployments. Includes venv isolation, systemd unit, and streamable HTTP wrapper. Contributed by @Tikilou. Closes #7.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-04-01

### New tools

- **`get_broken_links(repo)`** — scan all indexed doc sections for internal cross-references that no longer resolve. Checks markdown `[text](target)` links, RST `:ref:`/`:doc:` directives, and anchor-only links (`#heading`). External links (http/https/mailto) are skipped. Each broken entry reports `source_file`, `source_section`, `target`, and `reason` (`file_not_found` | `section_not_found` | `anchor_not_found`). Pure index scan — no re-reading source files.
- **`get_doc_coverage(repo, symbol_ids)`** — given a list of jcodemunch symbol IDs, reports which symbols are mentioned in section titles (documented) vs absent (undocumented). Bridges jcodemunch ↔ jdocmunch. `symbol_ids` capped at 200. Output: `{documented, undocumented, coverage_pct}`.

### Tests

- 26 new tests (298 total)

## [1.4.6] — 2026-03-31

### Housekeeping

- Added `LICENSE` file (dual-use: free for non-commercial, paid for commercial)

## [1.4.0] — 2026-03-13

### New features

- **`get_section_context` tool** — returns a target section's full content alongside its ancestor heading chain (root→parent) and immediate child summaries, all under a configurable `max_tokens` budget. Eliminates the need for whole-file reads when a section alone is too thin to answer a question.
- **sentence-transformers embedding backend** — fully offline embeddings via `sentence-transformers` (default model `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, override with `JDOCMUNCH_ST_MODEL`). Auto-detected as fallback after Gemini/OpenAI. Nothing leaves the machine.
- **tiktoken-aware token counting** — `count_tokens()` in `storage/token_tracker.py` uses `tiktoken` when installed (cl100k_base), falling back to bytes/4 when not present. Opt-in: no new required dependency.
- **`incremental` parameter on `index_local` and `index_repo`** — callers can now pass `incremental: false` to force a full re-index without deleting the existing index first.

### Performance and correctness

- **In-memory index cache** — `load_index()` now caches parsed `DocIndex` objects keyed by path + `mtime_ns`. Zero `json.load()` calls on repeated tool calls against the same unchanged repo.
- **True incremental GitHub indexing** — `index_repo(incremental=True)` now fetches the HEAD commit SHA first and exits immediately (no tree or file fetches) when the SHA matches the stored value. HEAD SHA stored in the index.
- **Hierarchical section IDs** — slugs are now prefixed with the ancestor heading chain (e.g. `installation/prerequisites` instead of bare `prerequisites`). A new heading inserted in one branch no longer renumbers IDs in other branches. `INDEX_VERSION` bumped to `2` — existing indexes are automatically re-indexed on first access.

### Documentation

- SPEC, ARCHITECTURE, USER_GUIDE, and README audited and reconciled against code reality
- `verify` parameter correctly described as cache integrity verification, not live-source drift detection
- Section ID format updated to show hierarchical slug paths
- Embedding environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `JDOCMUNCH_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`, `JDOCMUNCH_ST_MODEL`) documented throughout

### Tests

- 8 new `get_section_context` tests (248 → 256 total)

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-08

- OpenAPI 3.x / Swagger 2.x parser (`parser/openapi_parser.py`)
- `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.json` files content-sniffed: indexed when spec contains `openapi:` or `swagger:` key; skipped otherwise
- Operations grouped by tag → `## Tag` sections; each endpoint becomes a `### METHOD /path` subsection with parameters, request body, and responses rendered
- Schemas / Definitions section appended with property types and required markers
- `pyyaml>=6.0` already a hard dependency (no new deps)
- 25 new tests (176 → 201 total)

changes without a major version bump.

### Stable feature set

**Document formats** (11 formats, 14 extensions):
- `.md`, `.markdown`, `.mdx` — Markdown (ATX + setext headings, MDX preprocessing)
- `.txt` — plain text paragraph splitting
- `.rst` — RST heading/adornment parser
- `.adoc`, `.asciidoc`, `.asc` — AsciiDoc `=` heading parser
- `.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook JSON → Markdown conversion
- `.html`, `.htm` — HTML → text conversion, chrome stripped

**Indexing**
- Incremental indexing: hash-based change detection, only changed/new files re-parsed, atomic save
- Full indexing with gitignore-aware file discovery and security filtering

**Retrieval**
- O(1) section lookup via `__post_init__` id→section dict
- Byte-offset content retrieval with SHA-256 content hash verification
- Token savings tracking (raw file size vs. section response size)

**AI summaries**
- Claude Haiku (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) or Gemini Flash (`GOOGLE_API_KEY`) for section summaries
- Graceful fallback to heading text when no AI key is set

**Security**
- Path traversal protection on all file I/O
- Secret file detection (`.env`, `.pem`, credentials, keys)
- Binary file filtering
- Max file size enforcement

**Test coverage**: 201 tests passing.
