# jdocmunch-mcp

**Version:** 1.119.0 + unreleased branch `coordinated-retirement` @ `8d15897`
(#93 arc, NOT published; master merged up through 1.119.0; all 8 CI jobs green,
head HELD for rknighton's PR) | **Tests:** `PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/ -q`

## v1.119.0 — 5th absence refusal rule: a rebuild underneath a scan cannot prove absence

Suite parity with jcm v1.108.168. v1.117.0's four rules (only `absent`;
not `low_confidence`/`degraded`; not stale; not truncated) had **no rule for an
index being REWRITTEN while the scan reads it**. Index staleness here is
`source_dirty` = the SOURCE moved; it is **blind to a reindex that rewrites
sections under an unchanged tree**, so such a scan reported `index:"fresh"`,
reached `absent`, and minted a citable `absent:<sha>` ref over a half-written
index. **Worse here than in the siblings**: sections score through a lazy
`_content_loader` that reads body text from disk at scan time, so a rebuild
mid-scan can move the very bytes being ranked.

Fix: zero results + detected rewrite ⇒ `degraded`, so the 5th rule **falls out
of the existing "only `absent` proves absence" check** — nothing new to keep in
sync. `absence_refusal` gains a branch BEFORE the generic state check so the
reason names the rebuild. `channels.index` gains **`"rebuilding"`, disclosed on
EVERY state** (an `ok` caller deserves to know the index moved under it); only
the absence CLAIM is refused.

⚠ Detection is a **FILESYSTEM** signal — `DocStore._stamp_load_provenance`
stamps `_index_path` + `_loaded_mtime_ns` at BOTH load return points (cache hit
and cold), `retrieval.verdict.index_changed_since_load` re-stats. **NOT
in-process reindex state**: a separate watcher process drives most rebuilds and
in-process state cannot see it. **Unknown ≠ changed** (unstamped index → False).
⚠ `doc_store.py` has NO module `logger` — the helper builds one locally in its
except (the jcm v1.108.100 NameError-in-except trap).

Files: `storage/doc_store.py`, `retrieval/verdict.py`, `handoff.py`,
`tools/search_sections.py`. Tests `tests/test_v1_119_0.py` (13). NO
tool/schema/INDEX_VERSION change. jdoc publishes no JSON Schema, so unlike jcm
there was no enum to update.

## v1.118.0 - lexical query no longer lowercased before tokenizing (#91 follow-up)
Reported by @tetiz123 while validating the v1.114.1 CJK tokenizer on a real
111-doc / 2,053-section Korean corpus (fix confirmed: no reindex, lexical went
from nothing to their best ranker). Second, unrelated defect found while
measuring. `DocIndex._lexical_search` passed `query.lower()` to the scorer, but
`bm25.tokenize` inserts CamelCase boundaries BEFORE lowercasing, so the query
side and document side disagreed for case-bearing identifiers:
`tokenize("OvertimeService")` -> `['overtime','service']` (doc) vs
`tokenize("overtimeservice")` -> `['overtimeservice']` (query). Every
code-identifier query scored 0.0 and returned a SILENT empty list - silent
because the Stage-A posting prune tokenizes the ORIGINAL query, so candidates
survive the prune then each scores 0 in Stage B. CamelCase + acronym-suffix
(`HCA060T`) hit; underscore names (`SPM_NOTIFICATION`) unaffected (delimiter is
case-independent). **Fix:** pass the raw query to `_score_section` ->
`bm25.score_section`; `tokenize` lowercases internally after de-camel, so it is
correct and free. `_score_section`'s first param renamed `query_lower` ->
`query` (both call sites in `_lexical_search` + the hybrid lexical leg updated);
`query_words` (tag kicker) stays the lowercased set (tags matched case-folded).
Consumer-layer, NO reindex (`tokenize` runs on stored content at scoring time).
Tests `tests/test_v1_118_0.py` (7: root-cause asymmetry + e2e CamelCase/acronym/
repository identifiers + underscore control + lowercase-prose control); suite
1831. Additive/1.x, no INDEX_VERSION or tool-count change. **Shipped from MASTER
as a patch while `coordinated-retirement` (1.115.0) stays HELD; on merge resolve
versions up and keep all CHANGELOG entries.**

## v1.117.0 - absence evidence (handoff/v2 phase 3, suite parity)
Suite parity with jcm v1.108.166 (jcodemunch-mcp#377 phase 3, design by
@mightydanp). A ZERO-RESULT section search is now citable proof. v1/v2 could
not cite it (nothing served, no id), yet "searched the complete/fresh/
non-truncated index and it is NOT there" is the claim audits most need.
`build_verdict` already emits state/scanned/channels/coverage/scorer;
`handoff.note_absence` records those under a deterministic ref. An `absent`
verdict surfaces a citable ref. **jdoc-specific carrier:** its default
`meta_fields` STRIPS `_meta`, so the ref rides in `_meta.absence_evidence`,
re-attached AFTER filtering (the v1.104.0 budget lesson) - a token the default
config deletes is one the agent can never cite. **Refusal rules (his, verbatim):**
only `absent` proves absence; `low_confidence`/`degraded` do NOT; stale index
does NOT; truncated index does NOT. Refused scans STILL recorded so citing
returns the REASON (`refused_absence` / `refused_absence_claims`), not a bare
unknown-ref; absent-but-not-citable -> `_meta.absence_evidence.citable:false` +
`blocked_by`. Rendered proof carries tool+query, SCOPE, sections/documents
scanned, channels, coverage w/ exclusion counts, scorer; unknown coverage
disclosed as unknown NEVER as complete; detail renders ONCE. Ref = sha256[:12]
over `(tool, repo, query, scope)`; jdoc `_SCOPE_ARGS` = doc_path/path_glob/role/
tag/repo_group/lang. Session-scoped, in-memory, capped. Receipt gains
`absence_attested`. Additive/1.x, NO INDEX_VERSION/tool-count change. Tests
`tests/test_v1_117_0.py` (23, one per refusal rule); suite 1824.
**Shipped from MASTER while `coordinated-retirement` (1.115.0) stays HELD;
1.115.0 SKIPPED so the held branch keeps it; on merge resolve versions up + keep
all CHANGELOG entries.**

## v1.116.0 - claim-scoped evidence (handoff/v2 phase 1, suite parity)
Suite parity with jcm v1.108.165 / jdata v1.25.0 (jcodemunch-mcp#377 phase 1,
design by @mightydanp). A handoff section may now carry caller-authored
`claims`, each with its OWN `evidence_refs`. v1 proved a ref was retrieved
this session but never bound it to a sentence - refs landed in ONE global
block at the end of the body. New `_validate_claims` takes
`{id, statement, evidence_refs, classification?}`; **ids unique across the
WHOLE handoff, not per section** (the id is the citation anchor - two sections
owning one id makes a citation ambiguous); statements/classifications
preserved VERBATIM (server never authors); each claim's refs attested
SEPARATELY through the unchanged `_validate_evidence`, so an unknown ref
returns `invalid_claims: [{claim_id, unknown_refs}]` naming the claim instead
of one global failure list. `render_handoff` prints `### <statement>` +
`- Claim id:` + indented evidence, and takes the schema string as a param.
**Three calls carried from jcm:** (1) the INPUT picks the contract - no claims
anywhere means the schema stays `jdocmunch.handoff/v1`, body BYTE-IDENTICAL to
v1, `claims_attested` omitted (not `0`); any claim promotes to `.../v2`.
(2) claims can satisfy `evidence_refs` (top-level may be empty when claims
carry refs - strictly more permissive, no existing call changes). (3) claim
refs join the canonical index, caller order first, so a v1 consumer reading a
v2 handoff sees every ref where it expects. Section `content` optional ONLY
when claims present. Additive/1.x, no INDEX_VERSION or tool-count change.
Tests `tests/test_v1_116_0.py` (18, incl. the byte-identical-v1 guard); suite 1801.
WARNING **Known limit, disclosed on #377 first:** phase 1 does NOT narrow what
counts as a match - the doc-path broadening in `_validate_evidence` means
citing a whole document still attests when one unrelated section from it was
served. That is phase 2 (evidence receipts), DEFERRED.
**Shipped from MASTER as a patch (like 1.114.1 / 1.114.2) while
`coordinated-retirement` (1.115.0) stays HELD for rknighton's re-verification.
1.115.0 deliberately SKIPPED so the held branch keeps that number; on merge,
resolve version conflicts to the higher number and keep all CHANGELOG
entries.**

## #93/#95 contribution path DECIDED 2026-07-26: rknighton implements, via PR

Answered the contribution-path question he raised on #93 and escalated on #95 as
formally unanswered: **option 3, a PR against `coordinated-retirement`.**
⚠ **The deciding factor is the CLA, not review convenience.** `CONTRIBUTING.md:7`
makes a signed CLA a hard merge gate (jdoc is dual-licensed, paid commercial
tier), and he has **16 issues / ZERO PRs** here, so nothing is on file.
⚠ **A patch pasted into an issue is the WORST of the three options** — real code
with no signing record at all — which inverts the intuition that a patch is the
lighter-weight ask. A PR makes cla-assistant prompt automatically. Same
reasoning that closed jcm#380.

⚠ **Independence: the ORACLE survives his authorship, his JUDGMENT does not.**
jjg committed on #90 that v1.115 is held for independent re-verification and
QA-17 will not be self-certified. `qa_lifecycle_contract.py` is already LOCKED
with published pre-fix receipts (3 passed / 4 failed at `99a31c1`, identical
across 5 runs) and #95's acceptance criteria predate any implementation — that
is pre-registration, so the gate cannot be reshaped to fit the fix. What is lost
is his adversarial pass on the new code; **that role moves to US, and the release
notes must SAY so** rather than let the record imply author-verification.

PR scope requested: QA-19 + QA-23 + QA-21 + the `reason_code` vocabulary w/
SPEC.md drift guard, Path A. Follow-ons: process-interruption durability,
installed-wheel matrix, frozen-SHA run. **QA-25 was in that scope and we then
took it — see below. Disclosed on #95 rather than left for him to find, with an
offer to revert if his local version differs, since he owns the contract.**

## QA-25 SHIPPED by us 2026-07-26 (`8d15897`): intent is stated, never inferred

Closes the branch's single known red test, Linux-only
`test_v1_115_0_lifecycle_v2.py::test_three_processes_keep_one_lock_inode`
("DID NOT RAISE Empty"). ⚠ **Root cause is NOT the default's value — it is that
two tests asked the default to arbitrate a question it cannot answer.** Both
production callers were ALREADY explicit (`tools/delete_index.py:36` `False`,
`tools/index_local.py:231` `True`), so **those two tests were the only implicit
callers in the entire repo**, requiring OPPOSITE behavior on the SAME lock. No
default could satisfy both. At `False` the QA-15 deleter returned instead of
blocking, so nothing reached the queue and `pytest.raises(queue.Empty)` got a
value.

Fix is the reviewer's rule, verbatim: every contention-sensitive caller states
whether it waits or refuses; the lock never infers intent from surrounding
state. QA-15 deleter → `lock_wait=True`; QA-17 gate contender →
`lock_wait=False`; `⚠ UNRESOLVED` docstring block replaced with the resolution.
⚠ **This SUPERSEDES our proposed retirement-record inference — do not resurrect
it.** It also dissolved a constraint that was OURS, not his: we were trying to
satisfy both tests WITHOUT editing either, and their author told us to edit them.

⚠ **The default STAYS `False`, and that is a data-loss argument, not a
preference:** a caller that forgets to say gets the REFUSING behavior, which
preserves the QA-17 guarantee that both participating indexes are never
simultaneously absent. Defaulting to blocking would make forgetting cost an
index. New `tests/test_v1_115_0_qa25.py` pins it by signature inspection.

⚠ **The second guard is a PRESENCE check, deliberately, and its docstring says
so.** It asserts each contention-sensitive function contains a
`delete_index(..., lock_wait=<expected>)` call and says nothing about its other
calls. **Our first version demanded EVERY call be explicit and produced 8
findings that were all noise** — two of those functions also delete uncontended,
as first acquirers where the flag cannot change the outcome. It is a
signature-level assertion on purpose: it runs on BOTH platforms, whereas the
behavioral test that would catch the loss SKIPS on Windows, which is exactly how
this regressed unnoticed. Both guards proven non-vacuous (remove the argument →
guard fails naming function+line; flip the default → drift assertion fails).

Receipts, all 8 jobs green at `8d158975ad2b515289c8ad524f3e2b971d397dbe`
([run 30204690565](https://github.com/jgravelle/jdocmunch-mcp/actions/runs/30204690565)):
Linux 1875 passed / 9 skipped ×4, Windows 1870 passed / 14 skipped ×4. Against
`69c91c4`, Linux went 1 failed / 1872 passed → 0 failed / 1875 passed.
⚠ **The 1875/1870 split is 5 POSIX-only tests (9 vs 14 skips, identical 1884
totals) and QA-15 is one of them — that number IS the QA-24 mechanism**, so
never read a Windows pass as verifying a locking contract.

**CI: `fail-fast: false` added to the Tests matrix (`69c91c4`).** One ubuntu-3.10
failure was cancelling all four Windows jobs, so the frozen review SHA carried
NO Windows result while the panel showed 8 failures where there was 1. Code
identical to the old pin (`git diff --stat 99a31c1 69c91c4 -- src/ tests/
pyproject.toml` is empty), announced on-issue rather than pushed quietly.
⚠ **RETRACTED on the record: our claim that the draft PR's `synchronize` event
"has not been firing" is WRONG** — `gh run list` shows `pull_request`-event runs
at BOTH `99a31c1` and `69c91c4`. Branch CI has been firing on push all along;
cancellations made those runs unreadable in the panel. `workflow_dispatch` is
still worth keeping (re-run any ref without pushing), but the diagnosis attached
to it was false. Head is HELD from here while he works.

## #95 merge-closure candidate: authority and public deletion are explicit

Retirement authority is scoped to one durable publication. Record creation,
replacement, cleanup, reverse-scan repair, and stale self-healing revalidate
under the record lock; final deletion requires the exact current publication
and re-proves fingerprints after retained-handle coordination. A stale
publication cannot authorize or clean up a newer one.

Public `delete_index` uses `lock_wait=False` for one immediate coordination
attempt and returns the existing retryable lifecycle-busy result on contention.
Internal retirement remains explicit with `lock_wait=True` and its bounded
wait. Successful deletion leaves the stable per-index lockfile in place and
keeps primary-last ordering.

The deleted, missing, and lifecycle-contention responses have one authoritative
runtime vocabulary. `SPEC.md` publishes the exact table, and a focused drift
guard compares it with runtime behavior. QA-25's caller-explicit wait policy
and low-level nonblocking default are preserved and verified, not redesigned.

Evidence for this candidate is currently limited to focused local Windows
tests and the unchanged frozen lifecycle harness. Do not infer Linux validation,
submission readiness, maintainer approval, or independent final review from
that evidence.

## CHANGELOG maintenance warning (2026-07-18 incident)
CHANGELOG.md's established format is `## [X.Y.Z] - date - title` with curated
prose. Do NOT run `scripts/generate_changelog.py` against it: the script emits
a different heading format and rewrites all historical entries, which changes
every CHANGELOG section id — and the replay self-fixture's goldens for
'hybrid search' / 'broken links' / 'openai compatible embeddings' point at
CHANGELOG section ids, so regeneration turned Tests+Replay red on an otherwise
docs-only commit (recall 1.0 -> 0.7, exactly the 3 CHANGELOG goldens).
Maintain CHANGELOG by hand-appending entries in the established format, and
keep new entry wording clear of fixture query phrases
([[feedback_fixture_query_corpus_pollution]] class).


## Replay-corpus warning: trimming CLAUDE.md can break the replay gate

Same class as the CHANGELOG incident above, hit 2026-07-26 while tracking
`docs/CLAUDE-history.md`. ⚠ **The replay self-fixture indexes `repo_path: "."` —
the WHOLE REPO — so any large markdown file added to the tree joins the retrieval
corpus and competes with the goldens.** Tracking 115 KB of trimmed release-brief
prose dropped nDCG to **0.906 against a 0.95 gate with recall still 1.0** (every
golden found, just outranked), failing
`test_replay_metrics.py::TestGate::test_pass_when_within_gate` and
`TestBaselineLock::test_self_fixture_meets_lock`.

⚠ **It was INVISIBLE to CI because the file was UNTRACKED — a fresh clone did not
have it.** Local runs were red while all 8 CI jobs at `69c91c4` were green. Any
"CI is green at the frozen SHA" claim is blind to untracked working-tree files.

Fix was not a new judgment: **`CLAUDE.md` is ALREADY in the fixture's
`extra_ignore_patterns`** for precisely this reason (recorded there: its
tool-keyword-dense entries shadow stable CHANGELOG goldens, e.g. 'broken links'
demoted by the #47-50 release notes at v1.77.0). `docs/CLAUDE-history.md` **IS
that content**, so trimming into it moved the shadowing prose out from under its
own exclusion; the archive inherits the pattern. Goldens and the 0.95 gate
UNTOUCHED — ⚠ **never fix this class by moving a golden or lowering the gate; the
signal is correct, the corpus scope was wrong.**

Every future batch trimmed into `docs/CLAUDE-history.md` stays excluded, so this
will not recur for that file. It WILL recur for any new large doc added at a new
path ([[feedback_fixture_query_corpus_pollution]]).

## Release history
Versions 1.115.0 and earlier: see `docs/CLAUDE-history.md` (moved out of this file
2026-07-25). `CHANGELOG.md` covers most of them, but 1.67.0-1.92.0 and 1.96.0 exist
ONLY in the history file.

## Purpose
Documentation section indexing for the jMunch suite. Companion to jcodemunch-mcp (which owns code symbols). Do NOT add code/docstring parsing here.

## Supported Formats
`.md/.mdx`, `.rst`, `.adoc`, `.ipynb`, `.html`, `.txt`, `.yaml/.yml` (OpenAPI only), `.json/.jsonc`, `.xml/.svg/.xhtml`, `.tscn/.tres` (Godot scenes/resources), `.pdf/.docx/.pptx/.epub` (optional `[office]` extra, local indexing only, markitdown conversion)

## Key Modules
- `storage/doc_store.py` — DocIndex, DocStore, detect_changes, incremental_save
- `parser/` — one file per format (markdown, rst, asciidoc, notebook, html, text, openapi, json, xml)
- `tools/` — index_local, index_repo, index_file, get_toc, get_toc_tree, search_sections, get_section, get_sections, list_repos, delete_index, get_broken_links, get_doc_coverage, get_backlinks, get_stale_pages, get_wiki_stats, check_section_delete_safe, get_section_blast_radius, find_similar_sections
- `cli/hooks.py` — PreToolUse (Read interceptor) + PostToolUse (auto-reindex) + PreCompact (session snapshot) hook handlers for Claude Code; owns `_DOC_EXTENSIONS`
- `watch.py` — (#78) `watch` daemon: `discover_local_doc_repos` + `watch_docs` (watchfiles-based, incremental `index_local` refresh, rediscover loop)
- `service_installer.py` — (#78) cross-platform login-service installer for `watch` (`jdocmunch-watch`; systemd/launchd/Task Scheduler)
- `cli/init.py` — `jdocmunch-mcp init` full onboarding: client detection, config patching, CLAUDE.md policy, Cursor/Windsurf rules, hooks, index; `claude-md` subcommand
- `embeddings/` — provider.py (Gemini + OpenAI), cosine_similarity, embed_sections, embed_query

## CLI Subcommands

|------------|---------|
| `serve` (default) | Run the MCP server (stdio) |
| `init` | One-command onboarding: detect clients, write config, install policy, hooks, index |

## 1.x compatibility contract (license-binding)

Existing 1.x licensees must be able to upgrade between any two 1.x versions
with zero surprise. This is a hard constraint, not a guideline.

**Never on 1.x:**
- Remove or rename an MCP tool. Aliases for any rename must stay in place forever.
- Remove a `Section` field from `to_dict` output (additive only; new fields use the "omit when empty" convention).
- Drop a runtime dependency that an existing user might rely on (e.g. tiktoken stays optional; bytes/4 fallback stays).
- Force a reindex without auto-migrating on load. `INDEX_VERSION` bumps are allowed when the loader silently migrates v(N-1) → v(N) on first read.
- Change the JSON wire format of any tool response in a way that breaks an existing consumer. New keys are fine; renames + removals are not.
- Make a previously-default behavior raise. If we deprecate a flag value, keep it accepted (with a deprecation note in `_meta`) until a 2.x is approved.

**Acceptable on 1.x:**
- Add new tools, fields, response keys, env vars, kwargs (all defaulted to backwards-compat values).
- Tighten internal behavior (faster algorithms, better defaults) when no public output changes.
- Add new error returns for inputs that previously errored differently.
- Add new opt-in code paths gated by env var or kwarg.

**Reserved for 2.x (won't ship until a major-version license revision is planned):**
- See `todo.md` § "Reserved for 2.x" for the canonical list.

## Architecture
- INDEX_VERSION=3; version mismatch triggers auto-migration on first load (NEVER a forced reindex on 1.x)
- O(1) section lookup via `DocIndex.__post_init__` id dict
- `pyyaml>=6.0` required (hard dep)
- Hybrid search (v1.9.0): `search_sections` fuses BM25 + semantic cosine when embeddings exist. `use_embeddings` defaults to `"auto"` (embed when provider configured). `search_sections` params: `semantic` (None/auto, True, False), `semantic_only`, `semantic_weight` (0.0–1.0, default 0.5). `_meta.search_mode` reports `hybrid`/`semantic_only`/`lexical`.
- Embedding providers: GOOGLE_API_KEY (Gemini, text-embedding-004), OPENAI_API_KEY (text-embedding-3-small), openai-compatible + JDOCMUNCH_OPENAI_COMPAT_URL + JDOCMUNCH_OPENAI_COMPAT_MODEL, or sentence-transformers; override with JDOCMUNCH_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER env var
- Summarizer providers: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GOOGLE_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, MINIMAX_API_KEY, ZHIPUAI_API_KEY; override with JDOCMUNCH_SUMMARIZER_PROVIDER env var (values: anthropic, gemini, openai, minimax, glm, none)
