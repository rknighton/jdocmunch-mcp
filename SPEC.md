# Technical Specification

## Overview

**jdocmunch-mcp** pre-indexes documentation files by their heading hierarchy, assigning each section a stable ID and byte offsets for O(1) content retrieval. Agents discover sections via TOC or search, then retrieve only the content they need.

### Token Savings

| Scenario                              | Raw dump        | jDocMunch       | Savings |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------- |
| Browse 50-file doc set structure      | ~100,000 tokens | ~2,000 tokens   | **98%** |
| Find a specific configuration section | ~12,000 tokens  | ~400 tokens     | **97%** |
| Read one section body                 | ~12,000 tokens  | ~300 tokens     | **97.5%** |

## MCP Tools (11)

### Indexing Tools

#### `index_local` — Index a local documentation folder

```json
{
  "path": "/path/to/docs",
  "use_ai_summaries": true,
  "extra_ignore_patterns": ["drafts/**"],
  "follow_symlinks": false,
  "incremental": true
}
```

`incremental` (default `true`): only re-parse files whose content hash changed since the last index. Set to `false` to force a full re-index.

Walks the local directory with full security controls: path traversal prevention, symlink escape protection, secret detection, binary filtering, `.gitignore` respect, and directory pruning. Parses `.md`, `.mdx`, `.markdown`, `.txt`, and `.rst` files.

#### `index_repo` — Index a GitHub repository's documentation

```json
{
  "url": "owner/repo",
  "ref": "optional-branch-tag-or-commit",
  "name": "optional-safe-storage-name",
  "use_ai_summaries": true,
  "incremental": true
}
```

Fetches documentation files via the GitHub API, parses sections, and saves to local storage.

`ref` (optional): selects the GitHub branch, tag, or commit-ish to index. If omitted, `HEAD` is used. Explicit refs are resolved to a 40-hex commit SHA before fetching tree/content; unresolved explicit refs return an error instead of falling back to `HEAD`. Durable handles stay commit-SHA based via `repo_at_sha`.

`name` (optional): stores the index under `owner/name` instead of `owner/repo`. This is a storage-name override, not a moving alias. The value must be a single safe storage component using only letters, numbers, dot, underscore, and hyphen; `/`, `\`, and `@` are rejected. GitHub indexing responses include the upstream source identity as `source_repo`, and certified indexes include both `repo_at_sha` for the stored index and `source_repo_at_sha` for the upstream GitHub repository.

`incremental` (default `true`): first checks the selected GitHub ref's commit SHA — if it matches the stored SHA the call returns immediately without any file fetches. If the SHA differs, only changed files are re-parsed. Set to `false` to force a full re-index.

#### `delete_index` — Delete index for a repository

```json
{
  "repo": "owner/repo"
}
```

Deletes both the index JSON and the raw content cache directory.

##### Public result vocabulary

| Outcome | `success` | `reason_code` | `retryable` |
|---|---:|---|---:|
| Deleted | `true` | `index_deleted` | `false` |
| Missing | `false` | `index_not_found` | `false` |
| Lifecycle contention | `false` | `index_lifecycle_busy` | `true` |

Lifecycle contention returns promptly after one immediate coordination attempt,
without a retry sleep. Internal retirement cleanup retains its bounded wait.

---

### Discovery Tools

#### `list_repos` — List indexed documentation sets

No input required. Returns all indexed repositories with section counts, document counts, document type breakdown, and commit metadata when available. Clean Git-backed indexes include `repo_at_sha`, an immutable handle in the form `owner/repo@40hexsha`.

#### `doc_resolve_repo` — Resolve a filesystem path to its doc-index handle

```json
{
  "path": "C:\\projects\\project-docs\\guides\\intro.md"
}
```

Given an index root, subfolder, or file path, returns the matching documentation repo handle via stored `source_root` metadata — a response whose size is independent of how many indexes exist. Prefer this over `list_repos` when the path is known. Exact root match wins, then the most specific containing root; equally-specific duplicates return `ambiguous: true` with a bounded `candidates` list (max 5) plus `total_matches`. A path outside every index returns a compact not-found result. GitHub-indexed corpora (no `source_root`) never match. Read-only: never creates, refreshes, or deletes an index. Absolute paths are recommended; relative paths resolve against the server's working directory, echoed back as `_meta.resolved_path`.

**Linked Git worktrees (jdoc#83):** when no root matches but the path belongs to a linked-worktree family with an established index for the same repository-relative corpus location, the not-found response additively carries `canonical_candidates` (bounded, max 5) and a `worktree_resolution` object (`status`, `reason_code`, `identity` with lineage/relative-location/selection evidence states, `freshness`, `write_policy`, `did_write`, `next_action`). The requested path stays `found: false` / `indexed: false`, and selection evidence is reported as `unavailable` — a path alone never proves durable-selection identity. Discovery is strictly read-only and fails closed on any Git-evidence failure.

`index_local` applies the same resolver as a gate: an equivalent corpus in a linked worktree with a proven-fresh established index (same certified revision, no relevant uncommitted docs) is **reused** — the established handle is returned, nothing is created or refreshed. Stale, dirty, ambiguous, legacy-unresolved, or evidence-incomplete outcomes return a bounded decision with no persistent write. `worktree_mode="branch_local"` opts out and intentionally creates an exact-path index for the requesting worktree. Cross-worktree creation races contend on one lineage-keyed claim, extending the jdoc#82 single-winner rule.

#### `get_toc` — Flat table of contents

```json
{
  "repo": "owner/repo"
}
```

Returns all sections in document order with their IDs, titles, levels, and summaries. Content is excluded — use `get_section` to retrieve full content.

#### `get_toc_tree` — Nested table of contents tree

```json
{
  "repo": "owner/repo"
}
```

Returns sections organized by document, with parent/child heading relationships visible. Content excluded.

#### `get_document_outline` — Section hierarchy for one document

```json
{
  "repo": "owner/repo",
  "doc_path": "docs/configuration.md"
}
```

Returns the heading hierarchy for a single file without content. Lighter than `get_toc` when you already know which document is relevant.

---

### Search Tools

#### `search_sections` — Weighted section search

```json
{
  "repo": "owner/repo",
  "query": "authentication",
  "doc_path": "docs/security.md",
  "max_results": 10
}
```

Weighted scoring across title, summary, tags, and content. Returns summaries only — use `get_section` for full content. `doc_path` is optional; omit to search all documents. `repo` accepts the normal `owner/repo` identifier or a strict `owner/repo@40hexsha` handle; the latter resolves only when the stored index is clean and matches that exact commit.

---

### Retrieval Tools

#### `get_section` — Retrieve full content of one section

```json
{
  "repo": "owner/repo",
  "section_id": "owner/repo::docs/install.md::installation#1",
  "verify": true
}
```

Retrieves section source via byte-offset seeking (O(1)). Optional `verify` re-hashes the retrieved content and compares it to the stored `content_hash`. The response field `section.hash_verified` will be `true` if the cached file matches the stored hash, `false` if the cache has been modified since indexing. This is **cache integrity verification**, not live-source drift detection.

#### `get_section_context` — Retrieve a section with its hierarchy context

```json
{
  "repo": "owner/repo",
  "section_id": "owner/repo::docs/install.md::installation/prerequisites#3",
  "max_tokens": 2000,
  "include_children": true
}
```

Returns three components:
- **`ancestors`**: list of `{id, title, level}` dicts from root down to the immediate parent — provides orientation without bulk content
- **`section`**: the target section with full content (byte-range read, capped by `max_tokens`)
- **`children`**: immediate child section summaries (no content reads), included when `include_children=true`

Prevents "section too thin to answer" failures without falling back to whole-file reads.

#### `get_sections` — Batch retrieve multiple sections

```json
{
  "repo": "owner/repo",
  "section_ids": ["id1", "id2", "id3"],
  "verify": false
}
```

Returns a list of sections with full content, plus an error list for any IDs not found.

## Data Models

### Section

```python
@dataclass
class Section:
    id: str            # "{repo}::{doc_path}::{slug}#{level}"
    repo: str
    doc_path: str      # Relative path of the source document
    title: str         # Heading text
    content: str       # Full section text (heading + body, including subsections)
    level: int         # 1–6 (ATX heading level); 0 = pre-first-heading root section
    parent_id: str     # Section ID of parent heading; "" if top-level
    children: list     # List of child section IDs
    byte_start: int    # Start byte offset in the cached raw file
    byte_end: int      # End byte offset in the cached raw file
    summary: str       # One-sentence summary (heading text / AI / fallback)
    tags: list         # #hashtag tags extracted from content
    references: list   # URLs and markdown link targets extracted from content
    content_hash: str  # SHA-256 of section content (drift detection)
```

### DocIndex

```python
@dataclass
class DocIndex:
    repo: str              # "owner/repo"
    owner: str
    name: str
    indexed_at: str        # ISO timestamp
    doc_paths: list        # Sorted list of indexed document paths
    doc_types: dict        # {".md": 12, ".txt": 3}
    sections: list         # Serialized Section dicts (metadata only — no content field)
    index_version: int     # Schema version (current: 3); mismatch triggers full re-index
    file_hashes: dict      # {doc_path: SHA-256} for incremental change detection
    head_sha: str          # HEAD commit SHA when known (GitHub or local Git indexes)
    source_dirty: bool     # True when cached content is not certified clean at head_sha
    sha_certified: bool    # True when the corpus was built under strict repo@sha rules
    source_root: str       # Absolute source folder for local indexes, if known
    source_repo: str       # Original upstream GitHub repo for named GitHub indexes
```

`DocStore` persists each `DocIndex` as JSON plus cached raw document files.
`repo_at_sha` is derived, not stored: it is emitted only when `head_sha` is a 40-hex commit SHA, `source_dirty` is false, and `sha_certified` is true. Surgical `index_file` updates never certify a legacy, dirty, moved-HEAD, untracked-path, or no-longer-Git-backed local index; run `index_local` to recertify the full corpus.

For local Git indexes, "clean" means the *indexed corpus* is reproducible at `head_sha`, not that the source folder is pristine. `source_dirty` is set when tracked content within the indexed scope differs from HEAD, when HEAD moves mid-index, or when any indexed path is not tracked by Git — including a gitignored file indexed explicitly via `paths=[...]`, which `git status` cannot see and which is caught by a separate `git ls-files` tracked-ness check. Untracked files that are not part of the index — unsupported extensions, build artifacts, scratch files — do not affect certification. Git state is probed with short-lived `git` subprocesses bounded by `JDOCMUNCH_GIT_TIMEOUT` (seconds, default 10; set to a value `<= 0` to disable the ceiling); a timed-out or otherwise failed probe is treated as dirty so an immutable handle is never emitted for an unknown state.

## File Discovery

### GitHub Repositories

Fetches via GitHub API. `.gitignore` is fetched and respected (if present in the repo root).

### Local Folders

Recursive directory walk using `os.walk` with early directory pruning to skip `SKIP_PATTERNS` before descending.

### Filtering Pipeline (Both Paths)

1. **Skip patterns** — `node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `venv/`, `.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.git/`, `.tox/`, `.mypy_cache/`, `.gradle/`, `target/`
2. **`.gitignore`** — respected via the `pathspec` library
3. **`extra_ignore_patterns`** — user-supplied gitignore-style patterns (local only)
4. **Extension filter** — must be in `ALL_EXTENSIONS` (`.md`, `.markdown`, `.mdx`, `.txt`, `.rst`)
5. **Secret detection** — `.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, credentials files excluded
6. **Binary detection** — extension-based + null-byte content sniffing
7. **Size limit** — 500 KB per file
8. **File count limit** — 500 files max

---

## Section ID Format

```
{repo}::{doc_path}::{slug}#{level}
```

Examples:

```
owner/repo::README.md::installation#1
owner/repo::docs/config.md::authentication-options#2
local/myproject::guide.md::quick-start#1
```

**Slug:** heading text is lowercased and non-alphanumeric sequences replaced with hyphens, then **prefixed with the ancestor slug chain** to form a hierarchical path. For example, `### Prerequisites` under `## Installation` becomes `installation/prerequisites`. This makes IDs stable under sibling insertions: adding a new same-named heading in one branch of the document does not renumber IDs in another branch.

Section IDs are returned by `get_toc`, `get_toc_tree`, `get_document_outline`, and `search_sections`. Pass them to `get_section`, `get_sections`, or `get_section_context` to retrieve content.

---

## Response Envelope

Search and retrieval tools return a `_meta` object:

```json
{
  "_meta": {
    "latency_ms": 12,
    "sections_returned": 5,
    "tokens_saved": 1840,
    "total_tokens_saved": 94320,
    "cost_avoided": {
      "claude_opus": 0.0276,
      "gpt5_latest": 0.0184
    },
    "total_cost_avoided": {
      "claude_opus": 1.4148,
      "gpt5_latest": 0.9432
    }
  }
}
```

- **`tokens_saved`**: Tokens saved this call (raw bytes of matched docs vs response bytes, ÷ 4)
- **`total_tokens_saved`**: Cumulative tokens saved, persisted to `~/.doc-index/_savings.json`
- **`cost_avoided`**: Dollar value saved this call, valued at current model input rates (`storage/token_tracker.PRICING` is the authoritative table)
- **`total_cost_avoided`**: Cumulative cost avoided across all sessions

Present on: `search_sections`, `get_section`, `get_sections`.

## Reconciliation Status & Reason Codes

The complete runtime vocabulary for corpus-identity resolution and
provisional-index reconciliation (jdoc#80 arc; the published table required by
#84 item 4). Every value below is drift-guarded: a test fails if the runtime
can emit a status or reason code not listed here.

**`worktree_resolution.status`** (read-time resolution, jdoc#83):

| status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `exact` | The requested path is an indexed corpus root. |
| `created` | A new index was created for this corpus. |
| `reusable` | An established index for this corpus identity exists; its handle is returned without a write. |
| `reference_only` | An equivalent index exists but cannot be written from this location. |
| `ambiguous` | More than one stored index matches; no write, candidates listed. |
| `related` | Same repository lineage, different corpus location or selection. |
| `unknown` | Identity evidence unavailable; nothing asserted. |
| `no_match` | No stored index relates to this path. |

**`worktree_resolution.reason_code`** (read-time resolution, jdoc#83/#84;
the resolver-emitted codes were previously inline literals invisible to the
drift-guard — completed in jdoc#88 QA-05):

| reason_code | Emitted with status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `branch_local_created` | `created` | Explicit `worktree_mode="branch_local"`; exact-path creation rules apply. |
| `no_equivalent_candidate` | `no_match` | No stored index shares this path's lineage and corpus location. |
| `lineage_unknown` | `unknown` | The path is in Git but worktree lineage could not be confirmed; nothing asserted. |
| `lineage_conflict` | `unknown` | Collected lineage evidence disagrees with itself; nothing asserted. |
| `unique_location_candidate` | `reference_only` | Exactly one established index matches this worktree family and corpus location; returned for read-only use (durable selection was not compared, so this is never a reuse authorization). |
| `multiple_equivalent_candidates` | `ambiguous` | More than one established index matches; explicit selection required, no write. |
| `selection_incomplete` | `related` | Durable-selection evidence was incomplete; no automatic decision. |
| `equivalent_corpus_fresh` | `reusable` | A proven-equivalent established index is fresh; its handle is returned without a write. |
| `equivalent_corpus_dirty` | `reference_only` | An equivalent index exists, but this worktree has uncommitted changes under the corpus root; reuse is not proven safe. |
| `equivalent_corpus_stale` | `reference_only` | An equivalent index exists but is not proven fresh for this worktree. |
| `unresolved_legacy_candidate` | `related` | A related index predates selection identity and cannot be proven equivalent. |
| `new_corpus_created` | `created` | No established equivalent exists; creation proceeds under claim. |

**`git_verification.reason_code`** (`doc_resolve_repo` not-found responses,
jdoc#88 QA-04):

| reason_code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `git_verification_unavailable` | Git could not verify this path (missing binary, timeout, or permissions), so worktree-based canonical-index discovery was skipped. Distinct from a confirmed non-Git path, which omits this block entirely. `index_local` still works; an index created in this state is quarantined provisional until verification succeeds. |

**`reconciliation.reason_code`** (index-time quarantine, graduation, and
supersession; jdoc#80 Parts B/C, #85, #86):

| reason_code | Outcome |
|---|---|
| `provisional_verification_unavailable` | Git verification could not run; the index was created authority-free (provisional). |
| `graduated_verified` | Git lineage confirmed on a full refresh; the provisional index was promoted in place. |
| `reconciled_to_established` | Exact duplicate proven (verified identity + per-file hash equality); the provisional was retired and the established handle returned. |
| `graduation_ambiguous` | More than one established peer matches; kept provisional, nothing removed. |
| `graduation_content_diverged` | The provisional holds documents the established index lacks; kept provisional, nothing removed. |
| `graduation_content_differs` | Same paths, different or unprovable content; not a duplicate — both kept, differing files listed. |
| `superseded_by_established` | Git proved the provisional snapshot a strict ancestor of the established one (both certified clean); the older provisional was retired. |
| `provisional_newer_than_established` | Git proved the provisional snapshot strictly newer; the established index is never replaced automatically — both kept, explicit refresh path reported. |
| `supersession_conflict` | The target or candidate set changed before retirement; nothing removed, retry safe. |
| `supersession_cleanup_incomplete` | Supersession was proven, but a pre-commit publication or cleanup failure prevented the primary unlink; the provisional remains discoverable and retry is idempotent. |
| `graduation_cleanup_incomplete` | Exact-duplicate graduation was proven, but a pre-commit publication or cleanup failure prevented the primary unlink; nothing was reconciled, the provisional remains discoverable, and retry is idempotent. |
| `graduation_conflict` | An index changed between the exact-duplicate proof and physical removal; the guarded delete voided the retirement before touching anything — both indexes kept, retry safe. |

**`legacy_reconciliation.reason_code`** (Part C.2 — explicit-intent
reconciliation of genuine pre-1.102 fieldless legacy indexes; jdoc#87.
Fires only under `index_local(legacy_reconcile="report"|"apply")`; an
ordinary refresh stays backfill-only and never retires anything):

| reason_code | Outcome |
|---|---|
| `legacy_reconcile_no_modern_peer` | No non-provisional modern peer matches the verified corpus identity; the legacy index was refreshed and kept (an ordinary refresh backfills it), nothing removed. |
| `legacy_reconcile_ambiguous` | More than one modern peer matches; retirement requires exactly one, nothing removed. |
| `legacy_reconcile_uncertified` | The two indexes are not both clean and certified at the same commit; nothing removed. |
| `legacy_reconcile_content_differs` | A selected-handle path is missing from the peer or its stored hash differs (or is unprovable); not a duplicate — both kept, differing files listed. |
| `legacy_reconcile_ready` | Report mode: proof passed (single peer, same clean certified commit, full path-and-hash coverage); nothing was changed. |
| `legacy_reconciled_to_established` | Apply mode: proof repeated immediately before retirement; the selected legacy handle was retired, the peer is unchanged and its handle returned. |
| `legacy_reconcile_conflict` | The peer or candidate set changed between proof and retirement; nothing removed, retry safe. |
| `legacy_reconcile_cleanup_incomplete` | Retirement was proven, but a pre-commit publication or cleanup failure prevented the primary unlink; the legacy index remains discoverable and retry is idempotent. |

**Retirement coordination** (jdoc#88 QA-01/QA-02 + jdoc#89 QA-06..QA-11,
v1.115.0): every retirement path (legacy apply, supersession, exact-dedup
graduation) runs one coordinated destructive step. A guarded retirement
requires the explicit publication receipt created by its caller and a readable
current retirement record with that exact current publication identity;
record-path existence or a receiptless read of the current slot is not
destructive authority. Missing or unreadable fingerprints, a missing or
unreadable record, an omitted receipt, or a publication mismatch fail closed.
`None` never authorizes removal, and neither does an empty set of expected
fingerprints: a proof that asserts nothing is refused rather than treated as
an unguarded delete.
Monolith fingerprints for the retiring and retained handles may be checked
earlier for fast rejection, but final authorization is proved only after the
retained-handle gate is acquired and immediately before the primary
`<name>.json` commit. At that point the guarded `delete_index` re-verifies
every expected fingerprint and re-reads the exact publication while the
retiring-handle lock, record lock, and retained gate remain held through the
primary unlink and publication-scoped completion.

The retirement record is the PAIR coordination point (jdoc#90 QA-17): the
final step combines record coordination with a nonblocking retained-handle
gate. Public deletion uses zero-wait coordination, while internal retirement
uses its bounded wait where record voiding or cleanup must coordinate. A delete
first revalidates and voids records naming its target as retained before its
own destructive steps. A void landing before the final gate makes that gate
conflict and keeps the retiring handle; a delete arriving while the gate is
closed is refused and can succeed on retry. Path A keeps fixed
handle-then-record ordering and never blocks on the retained gate, so it does
not introduce pair locks, a second coordinator, or a cross-handle lock cycle.

A durable retiring record (`<owner>/.retirements/<name>.json`) is published
before the destructive step, fsync'd, with a per-publication-unique temp name,
and the publication receipt is required. A failed publication stops the
retirement before anything is removed. Completion, conflict cleanup, reverse
scans, and stale repair acquire the record lock and revalidate the current
record before unlinking it: stale or older cleanup cannot remove a newer
publication. Each operation completes or cleans up only its exact publication.
Every non-retired outcome occurs before the primary unlink and leaves the
retiring monolith loadable. Cleanup-incomplete reason codes describe only a
pre-commit failure, and a cleanup-incomplete outcome never follows a committed
primary unlink. After the primary unlink commits, the retirement result is
retired. If exact-publication record removal then fails, record cleanup failure
is disclosed additively on that retired result, including whether the durable
completion marker was persisted and whether a record remains. A fresh
pending-state read rechecks under the record lock that the retiring monolith is
still absent and self-heals the completed deletion when it can. A fresh
pending-state read returns the durable record when self-healing cannot remove
it, rather than falsely reporting no pending record. A rewrite of either
participant voids only the publication it revalidated; a failed save preserves
the existing record.

##### Retirement cleanup disclosure schema

These fields are additive and appear together only on a retired result when
the primary unlink committed but exact-publication record completion failed.
They never describe a pre-commit conflict. If exact-publication record cleanup
fails while a conflict has kept the retiring monolith loadable, the response
instead reports `pending_retirement: true` as the durable pre-commit recovery
signal and emits none of the four `retirement_cleanup_*` fields.

| Field | JSON type | Allowed values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `retirement_cleanup_pending` | `boolean` | `false`, `true` | True when durable record state remains readable or unreadable; false only when it is absent. |
| `retirement_cleanup_record_state` | `string` | `absent`, `readable`, `unreadable` | Observed durable retirement-record state after the completion attempt. |
| `retirement_cleanup_owned` | `boolean` | `false`, `true` | True only for a readable record whose `publication_id` equals the exact completing publication; false for absent, unreadable, or replacement state. |

`retirement_cleanup_pending` is derived from
`retirement_cleanup_record_state`: it is false for `absent` and true for
`readable` or `unreadable`. `retirement_cleanup_owned` is false when the record
is absent, unreadable, or belongs to a replacement publication. The fields
report observed durable state only; the failed completion adds no further
durable write while the record lock and retained gate are still held.

##### Retirement commit outcome matrix

| Scenario | Primary unlink committed | Returned retirement status | Retiring monolith | Cleanup fields | Durable recovery |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-commit refusal | `false` | non-retired | loadable | absent | Retry starts from the still-loadable retiring monolith. |
| Committed with complete record cleanup | `true` | retired | absent | absent | No retirement cleanup remains for that exact publication. |
| Committed with incomplete record cleanup | `true` | retired | absent | present | The four fields report durable state; a fresh pending read self-heals or returns the record. |

Availability is commit-scoped. At the protected A-to-B commit, B is loadable
and matches A's final authoritative proof. A change or removal of B before that
commit forces A to re-prove or fail closed. After A commits and releases
coordination, a later separately authorized B-to-C retirement may legitimately
remove B. No perpetual availability guarantee applies to historical A or B;
each successful commit guarantees only that its retained successor is loadable
at that protected commit.

`legacy_reconcile="report"` performs no writes on any outcome: it proves
from stored snapshots plus live Git evidence (both indexes certified clean
at the live checkout's clean commit), and its responses carry
`_meta.read_only: true`.

**Top-level `error` codes** (fail-closed refusals returned as
`{"success": false, "error": <code>, ...}` before any write — these two were
previously listed under `reconciliation.reason_code` /
`legacy_reconciliation.reason_code`, but they are actually returned as the
top-level `error` field; corrected in jdoc#88 QA-05):

| error | Outcome |
|---|---|
| `provisional_cap_exceeded` | Git verification was unavailable and the number of provisional indexes for this source root has reached the cap; creation refused, nothing written. |
| `legacy_reconcile_not_applicable` | A `legacy_reconcile` precondition failed (no explicit name, handle missing or not fieldless at call start, subset refresh, branch_local, provisional target, or unconfirmed Git lineage); refused fail-closed, nothing written. |

## Error Handling

All errors return:

```json
{
  "error": "Human-readable message"
}
```

| Scenario                           | Behavior                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Repository not found (GitHub 404)  | Error with message                                    |
| Rate limited (GitHub 403)          | Error with message; suggest setting `GITHUB_TOKEN`    |
