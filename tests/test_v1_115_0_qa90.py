"""jdoc#90 QA-17: the retirement record is the PAIR coordination point.

The guarded delete's final gate (fingerprint re-verify, record-existence
check, primary unlink, record removal) executes under the retirement
record's lock. A delete of the RETAINED peer must void that record through
the same lock before touching anything; while the gate is closed the delete
is refused. No interleaving can finish with both participating indexes
absent.
